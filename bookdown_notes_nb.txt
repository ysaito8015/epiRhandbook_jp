bookdown tips/instructions
23 jan 2021


-Copied yihui basic bookdown (entire folder) into handbook, but could not build from index.rmd,
because "Build Book" wasn't an option - only "Build website". So I went to Tools>Project Options>Build Tools
And left it set to website, but set the root site directory correctly to the handbook project subfolder that 
bookdown was living in. Then open index.rmd and build the gitbook.

To get new bs4 bookdown theme:
-ran: devtools::install_github('rstudio/bookdown@bs4-book-encoding', force = TRUE)
-I adjusted the color to burgundy within  


-I adjusted the font size of text (smaller) because code was being cut-off. I did this with html in hbk_css.css
/* Whole document: */
body{
  font-family: Helvetica;
  font-size: 10pt;
}
