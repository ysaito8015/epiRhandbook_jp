<div id="overview-4" class="section level2" number="26.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">26.1</span> Overview</h2>
<p>This page demonstrates the use of several packages for survey analysis.</p>
<p>Most survey R packages rely on the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survey/index.html"><strong>survey</strong> package</a>
for doing weighted analysis.
We will use <strong>survey</strong> as well as <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/srvyr/index.html"><strong>srvyr</strong></a>
(a wrapper for <strong>survey</strong> allowing for tidyverse-style coding) and
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gtsummary/index.html"><strong>gtsummary</strong></a>
(a wrapper for <strong>survey</strong> allowing for publication ready tables).
While the original <strong>survey</strong> package does not allow for tidyverse-style coding,
it does have the added benefit of allowing for survey-weighted generalised linear
models (which will be added to this page at a later date).
We will also demonstrate using a function from the <a href="https://github.com/R4EPI/sitrep"><strong>sitrep</strong></a>
package to create sampling weights (<em>n.b</em> this package is currently not yet on CRAN,
but can be installed from github).</p>
<p>Most of this page is based off work done for the <a href="https://r4epis.netlify.app/">“R4Epis” project</a>;
for detailed code and R-markdown templates see the <a href="https://github.com/R4EPI/sitrep">“R4Epis” github page</a>.
Some of the <strong>survey</strong> package based code is based off early versions of
<a href="https://github.com/EPIET/RapidAssessmentSurveys">EPIET case studies</a>.</p>
<p>At current this page does not address sample size calculations or sampling.
For a simple to use sample size calculator see <a href="https://www.openepi.com/Menu/OE_Menu.htm">OpenEpi</a>.
The <a href="https://epirhandbook.com/gis-basics.html">GIS basics</a> page of the handbook
will eventually have a section on spatial random sampling, and this page will
eventually have a section on sampling frames as well as sample size calculations.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">26.2</span> Preparation</h2>
<div id="packages-3" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Packages</h3>
<p>This code chunk shows the loading of packages required for the analyses. In this handbook we emphasize <code>p_load()</code> from <strong>pacman</strong>, which installs the package if necessary <em>and</em> loads it for use. You can also load packages with <code>library()</code> from <strong>base</strong> R. See the page on <a href="r-basics.html#r-basics">R basics</a> for more information on R packages.<br />
Here we also demonstrate using the <code>p_load_gh()</code> function from <strong>pacman</strong> to install a load a package from github which has not yet been published on CRAN.</p>
</div>
<div id="load-data-1" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Load data</h3>
<p>The example dataset used in this section:</p>
<ul>
<li>fictional mortality survey data.</li>
<li>fictional population counts for the survey area.</li>
<li>data dictionary for the fictional mortality survey data.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is based off the MSF OCA ethical review board pre-approved survey. The
fictional dataset was produced as part of the <a href="https://r4epis.netlify.app/">“R4Epis” project</a>.
This is all based off data collected using <a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/">KoboToolbox</a>,
which is a data collection software based off <a href="https://opendatakit.org/">Open Data Kit</a>.</p>
<p>Kobo allows you to export both the collected data, as well as the data dictionary
for that dataset. We strongly recommend doing this as it simplifies data cleaning
and is useful for looking up variables/questions.</p>
<p><span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong><em>TIP:</em></strong> The Kobo data dictionary has variable
names in the “name” column of the survey sheet.
Possible values for each variable are specified in choices sheet.
In the choices tab, “name” has the shortened value and the “label::english” and
“label::french” columns have the appropriate long versions.
Using the <strong>epidict</strong> package <code>msf_dict_survey()</code> function to import a Kobo
dictionary excel file will re-format this for you so it can be used easily to recode. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: orange;"><strong><em>CAUTION:</em></strong> The example dataset is not the same
as an export (as in Kobo you export different questionnaire levels individually)
- see the survey data section below to merge the different levels.</span></p>
<p>The dataset is imported using the <code>import()</code> function from the <strong>rio</strong> package. See the page on <a href="https://epirhandbook.com/import-and-export.html">Import and export</a> for various ways to import data.</p>
<p>The first 10 rows of the survey are displayed below.</p>
<p>We also want to import the data on sampling population so that we can produce
appropriate weights. This data can be in different formats, however we would
suggest to have it as seen below (this can just be typed in to an excel).</p>
<p>The first 10 rows of the survey are displayed below.</p>
<p>For cluster surveys you may want to add survey weights at the cluster level.
You could read this data in as above.
Alternatively if there are only a few counts, these could be entered as below
in to a tibble.
In any case you will need to have one column with a cluster identifier which
matches your survey data, and another column with the number of households in
each cluster.</p>
</div>
<div id="clean-data-2" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Clean data</h3>
<p>The below makes sure that the date column is in the appropriate format.
There are several other ways of doing this (see the <a href="https://epirhandbook.com/working-with-dates.html">Working with dates</a>
page for details), however using the dictionary to define dates is quick and easy.</p>
<p>We also create an age group variable using the <code>age_categories()</code> function from
<strong>epikit</strong> - see <a href="https://epirhandbook.com/cleaning-data-and-core-functions.html#num_cats">cleaning data</a>
handbook section for details.
In addition, we create a character variable defining which district the various clusters
are in.</p>
<p>Finally, we recode all of the yes/no variables to TRUE/FALSE variables - otherwise
these cant be used by the <strong>survey</strong> proportion functions.</p>
<!-- ======================================================= -->
</div>
</div>
<div id="survey-data" class="section level2" number="26.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">26.3</span> Survey data</h2>
<p>There numerous different sampling designs that can be used for surveys. Here
we will demonstrate code for:
- Stratified
- Cluster
- Stratified and cluster</p>
<p>As described above (depending on how you design your questionnaire) the data for
each level would be exported as a separate dataset from Kobo. In our example there
is one level for households and one level for individuals within those households.</p>
<p>These two levels are linked by a unique identifier.
For a Kobo dataset this variable is "_index" at the household level, which
matches the "_parent_index" at the individual level.
This will create new rows for household with each matching individual,
see the handbook section on <a href="https://epirhandbook.com/joining-data.html">joining</a>
for details.</p>
<!-- ======================================================= -->
</div>
<div id="observation-time" class="section level2" number="26.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">26.4</span> Observation time</h2>
<p>For mortality surveys we want to now how long each individual was present for in
the location to be able to calculate an appropriate mortality rate for our period
of interest. This is not relevant to all surveys, but particularly for mortality
surveys this is important as they are conducted frequently among mobile or displaced
populations.</p>
<p>To do this we first define our time period of interest, also known as a recall
period (i.e. the time that participants are asked to report on when answering
questions).
We can then use this period to set inappropriate dates to missing, i.e. if deaths
are reported from outside the period of interest.</p>
<p>We can then use our date variables to define start and end dates for each individual.
We can use the <code>find_start_date()</code> function from <strong>sitrep</strong> to fine the causes for
the dates and then use that to calculate the difference between days (person-time).</p>
<p>start date:
Earliest appropriate arrival event within your recall period
Either the beginning of your recall period (which you define in advance), or a
date after the start of recall if applicable (e.g. arrivals or births)</p>
<p>end date:
Earliest appropriate departure event within your recall period
Either the end of your recall period, or a date before the end of recall
if applicable (e.g. departures, deaths)</p>
<!-- ======================================================= -->
</div>
<div id="weighting" class="section level2" number="26.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">26.5</span> Weighting</h2>
<p>It is important that you drop erroneous observations before adding survey weights.
For example if you have observations with negative observation time, you will need
to check those (you can do this with the <code>assert_positive_timespan()</code> function
from <strong>sitrep</strong>.
Another thing is if you want to drop empty rows (e.g. with <code>drop_na(uid)</code>)
or remove duplicates (see handbook section on <a href="de-duplication.html#de-duplication">De-duplication</a>
for details).
Those without consent need to be dropped too.</p>
<p>In this example we filter for the cases we want to drop and store them in a separate
data frame - this way we can describe those that were excluded from the survey.
We then use the <code>anti_join()</code> function from <strong>dplyr</strong> to remove these dropped cases
from our survey data.</p>
<p><span style="color: red;"><strong><em>DANGER:</em></strong> You cant have missing values in your weight variable, or any of the variables relevant to your survey design (e.g. age, sex, strata or cluster variables).</span></p>
<p>As mentioned above we demonstrate how to add weights for three different study
designs (stratified, cluster and stratified cluster). These require information
on the source population and/or the clusters surveyed.
We will use the stratified cluster code for this example, but use whichever is
most appropriate for your study design.</p>
<!-- ======================================================= -->
</div>
<div id="survey-design-objects" class="section level2" number="26.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">26.6</span> Survey design objects</h2>
<p>Create survey object according to your study design.
Used the same way as data frames to calculate weight proportions etc.
Make sure that all necessary variables are created before this.</p>
<p>There are four options, comment out those you do not use:
- Simple random
- Stratified
- Cluster
- Stratified cluster</p>
<p>For this template - we will pretend that we cluster surveys in two separate
strata (health districts A and B).
So to get overall estimates we need have combined cluster and strata weights.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, there are two packages available for doing this. The
classic one is <strong>survey</strong> and then there is a wrapper package called <strong>srvyr</strong>
that makes tidyverse-friendly objects and functions. We will demonstrate both,
but note that most of the code in this chapter will use <strong>srvyr</strong> based objects.
The one exception is that the <strong>gtsummary</strong> package only accepts <strong>survey</strong> objects.</p>
<div id="survey-package" class="section level3" number="26.6.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">26.6.1</span> <strong>Survey</strong> package</h3>
<p>The <strong>survey</strong> package effectively uses <strong>base</strong> <em>R</em> coding, and so it is not
possible to use pipes (<code>%&gt;%</code>) or other <strong>dplyr</strong> syntax.
With the <strong>survey</strong> package we use the <code>svydesign()</code> function to define a survey
object with appropriate clusters, weights and strata.</p>
<p><span style="color: black;"><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> we need to use the tilde (<code>~</code>) in front of variables, this is because the package uses the <strong>base</strong> <em>R</em> syntax of assigning variables based on formulae. </span></p>
</div>
<div id="srvyr-package" class="section level3" number="26.6.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">26.6.2</span> <strong>Srvyr</strong> package</h3>
<p>With the <strong>srvyr</strong> package we can use the <code>as_survey_design()</code> function, which
has all the same arguments as above but allows pipes (<code>%&gt;%</code>), and so we do not
need to use the tilde (<code>~</code>).</p>
<!-- ======================================================= -->
</div>
</div>
<div id="descriptive-analysis-2" class="section level2" number="26.7">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">26.7</span> Descriptive analysis</h2>
<p>Basic descriptive analysis and visualisation is covered extensively in other
chapters of the handbook, so we will not dwell on it here.
For details see the chapters on <a href="https://epirhandbook.com/descriptive-tables.html">descriptive tables</a>,
<a href="https://epirhandbook.com/simple-statistical-tests.html">statistical tests</a>,
<a href="https://epirhandbook.com/tables-for-presentation.html">tables for presentation</a>,
<a href="https://epirhandbook.com/ggplot-basics.html">ggplot basics</a> and
<a href="https://epirhandbook.com/r-markdown-reports.html">R markdown reports</a>.</p>
<p>In this section we will focus on how to investigate bias in your sample and visualise this.
We will also look at visualising population flow in a survey setting using
alluvial/sankey diagrams.</p>
<p>In general, you should consider including the following descriptive analyses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Final number of clusters, households and individuals included<br />
</li>
<li>Number of excluded individuals and the reasons for exclusion</li>
<li>Median (range) number of households per cluster and individuals per household</li>
</ul>
<div id="sampling-bias" class="section level3" number="26.7.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">26.7.1</span> Sampling bias</h3>
<p>Compare the proportions in each age group between your sample and
the source population.
This is important to be able to highlight potential sampling bias.
You could similarly repeat this looking at distributions by sex.</p>
<p>Note that these p-values are just indicative, and a descriptive discussion (or
visualisation with age-pyramids below) of the distributions in your study sample
compared to the source population is more important than the binomial test itself.
This is because increasing sample size will more often than not lead to
differences that may be irrelevant after weighting your data.</p>
</div>
<div id="demographic-pyramids" class="section level3" number="26.7.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">26.7.2</span> Demographic pyramids</h3>
<p>Demographic (or age-sex) pyramids are an easy way of visualising the distribution
in your survey population. It is also worth considering creating
<a href="https://epirhandbook.com/descriptive-tables.html">descriptive tables</a> of age
and sex by survey strata.
We will demonstrate using the <strong>apyramid</strong> package as it allows for weighted
proportions using our survey design object created above. Other options for creating
<a href="https://epirhandbook.com/demographic-pyramids-and-likert-scales.html">demographic pyramids</a>
are covered extensively in that chapter of the handbook. We will also use a
wrapper function from <strong>sitrep</strong> called <code>plot_age_pyramid()</code> which saves a few lines
of coding for producing a plot with proportions.</p>
<p>As with the formal binomial test of difference, seen above in the sampling bias
section, we are interested here in visualising whether our sampled population
is substantially different from the source population and whether weighting corrects
this difference. To do this we will use the <strong>patchwork</strong> package to show our
<strong>ggplot</strong> visualisations side-by-side; for details see the section on
combining plots in <a href="https://epirhandbook.com/ggplot-tips.html?q=patch#combine-plots">ggplot tips</a>
chapter of the handbook.
We will visualise our source population, our un-weighted survey population and
our weighted survey population.
You may also consider visualising by each strata of your survey - in our example
here that would be by using the argument <code>stack_by  = "health_district"</code>
(see <code>?plot_age_pyramid</code> for details).</p>
<p><span style="color: black;"><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> The x and y axes are flipped in pyramids </span></p>
</div>
<div id="alluvialsankey-diagram" class="section level3" number="26.7.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">26.7.3</span> Alluvial/sankey diagram</h3>
<p>Visualising starting points and outcomes for individuals can be very helpful to
get an overview. There is quite an obvious application for mobile populations,
however there are numerous other applications such as cohorts or any other situation
where there are transitions in states for individuals. These diagrams have several
different names including alluvial, sankey and parallel sets - the details are
in the handbook chapter on <a href="https://epirhandbook.com/diagrams-and-charts.html#alluvialsankey-diagrams">diagrams and charts</a>.</p>
<!-- ======================================================= -->
</div>
</div>
<div id="weighted-proportions" class="section level2" number="26.8">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">26.8</span> Weighted proportions</h2>
<p>This section will detail how to produce tables for weighted counts and proportions,
with associated confidence intervals and design effect.
There are four different options using functions from the following packages:
<strong>survey</strong>, <strong>srvyr</strong>, <strong>sitrep</strong> and <strong>gtsummary</strong>.
For minimal coding to produce a standard epidemiology style table, we would
recommend the <strong>sitrep</strong> function - which is a wrapper for <strong>srvyr</strong> code; note
however that this is not yet on CRAN and may change in the future.
Otherwise, the <strong>survey</strong> code is likely to be the most stable long-term, whereas
<strong>srvyr</strong> will fit most nicely within tidyverse work-flows. While <strong>gtsummary</strong>
functions hold a lot of potential, they appear to be experimental and incomplete
at the time of writing.</p>
<div id="survey-package-1" class="section level3" number="26.8.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">26.8.1</span> <strong>Survey</strong> package</h3>
<p>We can use the <code>svyciprop()</code> function from <strong>survey</strong> to get weighted proportions
and accompanying 95% confidence intervals. An appropriate design effect can be
extracted using the <code>svymean()</code> rather than <code>svyprop()</code> function.
It is worth noting that <code>svyprop()</code> only appears to accept variables between 0 and
1 (or TRUE/FALSE), so categorical variables will not work.</p>
<p><span style="color: black;"><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> Functions from <strong>survey</strong> also accept <strong>srvyr</strong> design objects, but here we have used the <strong>survey</strong> design object just for consistency </span></p>
<p>We can combine the functions from <strong>survey</strong> shown above in to a function which
we define ourselves below, called <code>svy_prop</code>; and we can then use that function
together with <code>map()</code> from the purrr package to iterate over several variables
and create a table. See the handbook <a href="https://epirhandbook.com/iteration-loops-and-lists.html">iteration</a>
chapter for details on <strong>purrr</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="srvyr-package-1" class="section level3" number="26.8.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">26.8.2</span> <strong>Srvyr</strong> package</h3>
<p>With <strong>srvyr</strong> we can use <strong>dplyr</strong> syntax to create a table. Note that the
<code>survey_mean()</code> function is used and the proportion argument is specified, and
also that the same function is used to calculate design effect. This is because
<strong>srvyr</strong> wraps around both of the <strong>survey</strong> package functions <code>svyciprop()</code> and
<code>svymean()</code>, which are used in the above section.</p>
<p><span style="color: black;"><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> It does not seem to be possible to get proportions from categorical variables using <strong>srvyr</strong> either, if you need this then check out the section below using <strong>sitrep</strong> </span></p>
<p>Here too we could write a function to then iterate over multiple variables using
the <strong>purrr</strong> package.
See the handbook <a href="https://epirhandbook.com/iteration-loops-and-lists.html">iteration</a>
chapter for details on <strong>purrr</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="sitrep-package" class="section level3" number="26.8.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">26.8.3</span> <strong>Sitrep</strong> package</h3>
<p>The <code>tab_survey()</code> function from <strong>sitrep</strong> is a wrapper for <strong>srvyr</strong>, allowing
you to create weighted tables with minimal coding. It also allows you to calculate
weighted proportions for categorical variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="gtsummary-package" class="section level3" number="26.8.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">26.8.4</span> <strong>Gtsummary</strong> package</h3>
<p>With <strong>gtsummary</strong> there does not seem to be inbuilt functions yet to add confidence
intervals or design effect.
Here we show how to define a function for adding confidence intervals and then
add confidence intervals to a <strong>gtsummary</strong> table created using the <code>tbl_svysummary()</code>
function.</p>
<!-- ======================================================= -->
</div>
</div>
<div id="weighted-ratios" class="section level2" number="26.9">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">26.9</span> Weighted ratios</h2>
<p>Similarly for weighted ratios (such as for mortality ratios) you can use the
<strong>survey</strong> or the <strong>srvyr</strong> package.
You could similarly write functions (similar to those above) to iterate over
several variables. You could also create a function for <strong>gtsummary</strong> as above
but currently it does not have inbuilt functionality.</p>
