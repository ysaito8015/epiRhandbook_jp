<h1><span class="header-section-number">30</span> ggplot basics</h1>
<p><strong>ggplot2</strong> is the most popular data visualisation R package. Its <code>ggplot()</code> function is at the core of this package, and this whole approach is colloquially known as <em>“ggplot”</em> with the resulting figures sometimes affectionately called “ggplots”. The “gg” in these names reflects the “<strong>g</strong>rammar of <strong>g</strong>raphics” used to construct the figures. <strong>ggplot2</strong> benefits from a wide variety of supplementary R packages that further enhance its functionality.</p>
<p>The syntax is significantly different from <strong>base</strong> <code>R</code> plotting, and has a learning curve associated with it. Using <strong>ggplot2</strong> generally requires the user to format their data in a way that is highly <strong>tidyverse</strong> compatible, which ultimately makes using these packages together very effective.</p>
<p>In this page we will cover the fundamentals of plotting with <strong>ggplot2</strong>. See the page <a href="ggplot-tips.html#ggplot-tips">ggplot tips</a> for suggestions and advanced techniques to make your plots really look nice.</p>
<p>There are several extensive <strong>ggplot2</strong> tutorials linked in the resources section. You can also download this <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf">data visualization with ggplot cheatsheet</a> from the RStudio website. If you want inspiration for ways to creatively visualise your data, we suggest reviewing websites like the <a href="https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/">R graph gallery</a> and <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveats.html">Data-to-viz</a>.</p>

<div id="load-packages-20" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Load packages</h3>
<p>This code chunk shows the loading of packages required for the analyses. In this handbook we emphasize <code>p_load()</code> from <strong>pacman</strong>, which installs the package if necessary <em>and</em> loads it for use. You can also load installed packages with <code>library()</code> from <strong>base</strong> R. See the page on <a href="r-basics.html#r-basics">R basics</a> for more information on R packages.</p>

<h3>Import data</h3>
<p>We import the dataset of cases from a simulated Ebola epidemic. If you want to follow along, <a href='https://github.com/epirhandbook/Epi_R_handbook/raw/master/data/case_linelists/linelist_cleaned.rds' class='download-button'>click to download the “clean” linelist</a> (as .rds file). Import your data with the <code>import()</code> function from the <strong>rio</strong> package (it accepts many file types like .xlsx, .rds, .csv - see the <a href="import-and-export.html#import-and-export">Import and export</a> page for details).</p>
<p>The first 50 rows of the linelist are displayed below. We will focus on the continuous variables <code>age</code>, <code>wt_kg</code> (weight in kilos), <code>ct_blood</code> (CT values), and <code>days_onset_hosp</code> (difference between onset date and hospitalisation).</p>
</div>
<div id="general-cleaning" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>General cleaning</h3>
<p>When preparing data to plot, it is best to make the data adhere to <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html">“tidy” data standards</a> as much as possible. How to achieve this is expanded on in the data management pages of this handbook, such as <a href="cleaning-data-and-core-functions.html#cleaning-data-and-core-functions">Cleaning data and core functions</a>.</p>
<p>Some simple ways we can prepare our data to make it better for plotting can include making the contents of the data better for display - which does not necessarily equate to better for data manipulation. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replace <code>NA</code> values in a character column with the character string “Unknown”<br />
</li>
<li>Consider converting column to class <em>factor</em> so their values have prescribed ordinal levels<br />
</li>
<li>Clean some columns so that their “data friendly” values with underscores etc are changed to normal text or title case (see <a href="characters-and-strings.html#characters-and-strings">Characters and strings</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some examples of this in action:</p>
</div>
<div id="pivoting-longer" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Pivoting longer</h3>
<p>As a matter of data structure, for <strong>ggplot2</strong> we often also want to pivot our data into <em>longer</em> formats. Read more about this is the page on <a href="pivoting-data.html#pivoting-data">Pivoting data</a>.</p>
<p>For example, say that we want to plot data that are in a “wide” format, such as for each case in the <code>linelist</code> and their symptoms. Below we create a mini-linelist called <code>symptoms_data</code> that contains only the <code>case_id</code> and symptoms columns.</p>
<p>Here is how the first 50 rows of this mini-linelist look - see how they are formatted “wide” with each symptom as a column:</p>
<p>If we wanted to plot the number of cases with specific symptoms, we are limited by the fact that each symptom is a specific column. However, we can <em>pivot</em> the symptoms columns to a longer format like this:</p>
<p>Here are the first 50 rows. Note that case has 5 rows - one for each possible symptom. The new columns <code>symptom_name</code> and <code>symptom_is_present</code> are the result of the pivot. Note that this format may not be very useful for other operations, but is useful for plotting.</p>

<div id="basics-of-ggplot" class="section level2" number="30.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">30.2</span> Basics of ggplot</h2>
<p><strong>“Grammar of graphics” - ggplot2</strong></p>
<p>Plotting with <strong>ggplot2</strong> is based on “adding” plot layers and design elements on top of one another, with each command added to the previous ones with a plus symbol (<code>+</code>). The result is a multi-layer plot object that can be saved, modified, printed, exported, etc.</p>
<p>ggplot objects can be highly complex, but the basic order of layers will usually look like this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Begin with the baseline <code>ggplot()</code> command - this “opens” the ggplot and allow subsequent functions to be added with <code>+</code>. Typically the dataset is also specified in this command<br />
</li>
<li>Add “geom” layers - these functions visualize the data as <em>geometries</em> (<em>shapes</em>), e.g. as a bar graph, line plot, scatter plot, histogram (or a combination!). These functions all start with <code>geom_</code> as a prefix.<br />
</li>
<li>Add design elements to the plot such as axis labels, title, fonts, sizes, color schemes, legends, or axes rotation</li>
</ol>
<p>A simple example of skeleton code is as follows. We will explain each component in the sections below.</p>
</div>
<div id="ggplot" class="section level2" number="30.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">30.3</span> <code>ggplot()</code></h2>
<p>The opening command of any ggplot2 plot is <code>ggplot()</code>. This command simply creates a blank canvas upon which to add layers. It “opens” the way for further layers to be added with a <code>+</code> symbol.</p>
<p>Typically, the command <code>ggplot()</code> includes the <code>data =</code> argument for the plot. This sets the default dataset to be used for subsequent layers of the plot.</p>
<p>This command will end with a <code>+</code> after its closing parentheses. This leaves the command “open”. The ggplot will only execute/appear when the full command includes a final layer <em>without</em> a <code>+</code> at the end.</p>
</div>
<div id="geoms" class="section level2" number="30.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">30.4</span> Geoms</h2>
<p>A blank canvas is certainly not sufficient - we need to create geometries (shapes) from our data (e.g. bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, box plots).</p>
<p>This is done by adding layers “geoms” to the initial <code>ggplot()</code> command. There are many <strong>ggplot2</strong> functions that create “geoms”. Each of these functions begins with “geom_”, so we will refer to them generically as <code>geom_XXXX()</code>. There are over 40 geoms in <strong>ggplot2</strong> and many others created by fans. View them at the <a href="https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/">ggplot2 gallery</a>. Some common geoms are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Histograms - <code>geom_histogram()</code><br />
</li>
<li>Bar charts - <code>geom_bar()</code> or <code>geom_col()</code> (see <a href="ggplot-basics.html#ggplot_basics_bars">“Bar plot” section</a>)<br />
</li>
<li>Box plots - <code>geom_boxplot()</code><br />
</li>
<li>Points (e.g. scatter plots) - <code>geom_point()</code><br />
</li>
<li>Line graphs - <code>geom_line()</code> or <code>geom_path()</code><br />
</li>
<li>Trend lines - <code>geom_smooth()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In one plot you can display one or multiple geoms. Each is added to previous <strong>ggplot2</strong> commands with a <code>+</code>, and they are plotted sequentially such that later geoms are plotted on top of previous ones.</p>
</div>
<div id="ggplot_basics_mapping" class="section level2" number="30.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">30.5</span> Mapping data to the plot</h2>
<p>Most geom functions must be told <em>what to use</em> to create their shapes - so you must tell them how they should <em>map (assign) columns in your data</em> to components of the plot like the axes, shape colors, shape sizes, etc. For most geoms, the <em>essential</em> components that must be mapped to columns in the data are the x-axis, and (if necessary) the y-axis.</p>
<p>This “mapping” occurs with the <code>mapping =</code> argument. The mappings you provide to <code>mapping</code> must be wrapped in the <code>aes()</code> function, so you would write something like <code>mapping = aes(x = col1, y = col2)</code>, as shown below.</p>
<p>Below, in the <code>ggplot()</code> command the data are set as the case <code>linelist</code>. In the <code>mapping = aes()</code> argument the column <code>age</code> is mapped to the x-axis, and the column <code>wt_kg</code> is mapped to the y-axis.</p>
<p>After a <code>+</code>, the plotting commands continue. A shape is created with the “geom” function <code>geom_point()</code>. This geom <em>inherits</em> the mappings from the <code>ggplot()</code> command above - it knows the axis-column assignments and proceeds to visualize those relationships as <em>points</em> on the canvas.</p>
<p>As another example, the following commands utilize the same data, a slightly different mapping, and a different geom. The <code>geom_histogram()</code> function only requires a column mapped to the x-axis, as the counts y-axis is generated automatically.</p>
<div id="plot-aesthetics" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Plot aesthetics</h3>
<p>In ggplot terminology a plot “aesthetic” has a specific meaning. It refers to a visual property of <em>plotted data</em>. Note that “aesthetic” here refers to the <em>data being plotted in geoms/shapes</em> - not the surrounding display such as titles, axis labels, background color, that you might associate with the word “aesthetics” in common English. In ggplot those details are called “themes” and are adjusted within a <code>theme()</code> command (see <a href="ggplot-basics.html#ggplot_basics_themes">this section</a>).</p>
<p>Therefore, plot object <em>aesthetics</em> can be colors, sizes, transparencies, placement, etc. <em>of the plotted data</em>. Not all geoms will have the same aesthetic options, but many can be used by most geoms. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>shape =</code> Display a point with <code>geom_point()</code> as a dot, star, triangle, or square…<br />
</li>
<li><code>fill =</code> The interior color (e.g. of a bar or boxplot)<br />
</li>
<li><code>color =</code> The exterior line of a bar, boxplot, etc., or the point color if using <code>geom_point()</code><br />
</li>
<li><code>size =</code> Size (e.g. line thickness, point size)<br />
</li>
<li><code>alpha =</code> Transparency (1 = opaque, 0 = invisible)<br />
</li>
<li><code>binwidth =</code> Width of histogram bins<br />
</li>
<li><code>width =</code> Width of “bar plot” columns<br />
</li>
<li><code>linetype =</code> Line type (e.g. solid, dashed, dotted)</li>
</ul>
<p>These plot object aesthetics can be assigned values in two ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Assigned a static value (e.g. <code>color = "blue"</code>) to apply across all plotted observations<br />
</li>
<li>Assigned to a column of the data (e.g. <code>color = hospital</code>) such that display of each observation depends on its value in that column</li>
</ol>
<!-- *These non-axis aesthetics can be assigned static values (e.g. `size = 1`) or can be mapped to a column (e.g. `size = age`).* If you want the aesthetic to be assigned a static value, the assignment is placed *outside* the `mapping = aes()`. If you want the aesthetic to be scaled/depend on the value in each row of data, the assignment is made *inside* the `mapping = aes()`.   -->
</div>
<div id="set-to-a-static-value" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Set to a static value</h3>
<p>If you want the plot object aesthetic to be static, that is - to be the same for every observation in the data, you write its assignment within the geom but <em>outside</em> of any <code>mapping = aes()</code> statement. These assignments could look like <code>size = 1</code> or <code>color = "blue"</code>. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the first example, the <code>mapping = aes()</code> is in the <code>ggplot()</code> command and the axes are mapped to age and weight columns in the data. The plot aesthetics <code>color =</code>, <code>size =</code>, and <code>alpha =</code> (transparency) are assigned to static values. For clarity, this is done in the <code>geom_point()</code> function, as you may add other geoms afterward that would take different values for their plot aesthetics.<br />
</li>
<li>In the second example, the histogram requires only the x-axis mapped to a column. The histogram <code>binwidth =</code>, <code>color =</code>, <code>fill =</code> (internal color), and <code>alpha =</code> are again set within the geom to static values.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="scaled-to-column-values" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Scaled to column values</h3>
<p>The alternative is to scale the plot object aesthetic by the values in a column. In this approach, the display of this aesthetic will depend on that observation’s value in that column of the data. If the column values are continuous, the display scale (legend) for that aesthetic will be continuous. If the column values are discrete, the legend will display each value and the plotted data will appear as distinctly “grouped” (read more in the <a href="ggplot-basics.html#ggplotgroups">grouping</a> section of this page).</p>
<p>To achieve this, you map that plot aesthetic to a <em>column name</em> (not in quotes). This must be done <em>within a <code>mapping = aes()</code> function</em> (note: there are several places in the code you can make these mapping assignments, as discussed <a href="##ggplot_basics_map_loc">below</a>).</p>
<p>Two examples are below.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the first example, the <code>color =</code> aesthetic (of each point) is mapped to the column <code>age</code> - and a scale has appeared in a legend! For now just note that the scale exists - we will show how to modify it in later sections.<br />
</li>
<li>In the second example two new plot aesthetics are also mapped to columns (<code>color =</code> and <code>size =</code>), while the plot aesthetics <code>shape =</code> and <code>alpha =</code> are mapped to static values outside of any <code>mapping = aes()</code> function.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Axes assignments are always assigned to columns in the data (not to static values), and this is always done within <code>mapping = aes()</code>.</p>
<p>It becomes important to keep track of your plot layers and aesthetics when making more complex plots - for example plots with multiple geoms. In the example below, the <code>size =</code> aesthetic is assigned twice - once for <code>geom_point()</code> and once for <code>geom_smooth()</code> - both times as a static value.</p>
</div>
<div id="ggplot_basics_map_loc" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Where to make mapping assignments</h3>
<p>Aesthetic mapping within <code>mapping = aes()</code> can be written in several places in your plotting commands and can even be written more than once. This can be written in the top <code>ggplot()</code> command, and/or for each individual geom beneath. The nuances include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mapping assignments made in the top <code>ggplot()</code> command will be inherited as defaults across any geom below, like how <code>x =</code> and <code>y =</code> are inherited</li>
<li>Mapping assignments made within one geom apply only to that geom</li>
</ul>
<p>Likewise, <code>data =</code> specified in the top <code>ggplot()</code> will apply by default to any geom below, but you could also specify data for each geom (but this is more difficult).</p>
<p>Thus, each of the following commands will create the same plot:</p>
</div>
<div id="ggplotgroups" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Groups</h3>
<p>You can easily group the data and “plot by group”. In fact, you have already done this!</p>
<p>Assign the “grouping” column to the appropriate plot aesthetic, within a <code>mapping = aes()</code>. Above, we demonstrated this using continuous values when we assigned point <code>size =</code> to the column <code>age</code>. However this works the same way for discrete/categorical columns.</p>
<p>For example, if you want points to be displayed by gender, you would set <code>mapping = aes(color = gender)</code>. A legend automatically appears. This assignment can be made within the <code>mapping = aes()</code> in the top <code>ggplot()</code> command (and be inherited by the geom), or it could be set in a separate <code>mapping = aes()</code> within the geom. Both approaches are shown below:</p>
<p>Note that depending on the geom, you will need to use different arguments to group the data. For <code>geom_point()</code> you will most likely use <code>color =</code>, <code>shape =</code> or <code>size =</code>. Whereas for <code>geom_bar()</code> you are more likely to use <code>fill =</code>. This just depends on the geom and what plot aesthetic you want to reflect the groupings.</p>
<p>For your information - the most basic way of grouping the data is by using only the <code>group =</code> argument within <code>mapping = aes()</code>. However, this by itself will not change the colors, fill, or shapes. Nor will it create a legend. Yet the data are grouped, so statistical displays may be affected.</p>
<p>To adjust the order of groups in a plot, see the <a href="ggplot-tips.html#ggplot-tips">ggplot tips</a> page or the page on <a href="factors.html#factors">Factors</a>. There are many examples of grouped plots in the sections below on plotting continuous and categorical data.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="ggplot_basics_facet" class="section level2" number="30.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">30.6</span> Facets / Small-multiples</h2>
<p>Facets, or “small-multiples”, are used to split one plot into a multi-panel figure, with one panel (“facet”) per group of data. The same type of plot is created multiple times, each one using a sub-group of the same dataset.</p>
<p>Faceting is a functionality that comes with <strong>ggplot2</strong>, so the legends and axes of the facet “panels” are automatically aligned. There are other packages discussed in the <a href="ggplot-tips.html#ggplot-tips">ggplot tips</a> page that are used to combine completely different plots (<strong>cowplot</strong> and <strong>patchwork</strong>) into one figure.</p>
<p>Faceting is done with one of the following <strong>ggplot2</strong> functions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>facet_wrap()</code> To show a different panel for each level of a <em>single</em> variable. One example of this could be showing a different epidemic curve for each hospital in a region. Facets are ordered alphabetically, unless the variable is a factor with other ordering defined.<br />
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You can invoke certain options to determine the layout of the facets, e.g. <code>nrow = 1</code> or <code>ncol = 1</code> to control the number of rows or columns that the faceted plots are arranged within.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>facet_grid()</code> This is used when you want to bring a second variable into the faceting arrangement. Here each panel of a grid shows the intersection between values in <em>two columns</em>. For example, epidemic curves for each hospital-age group combination with hospitals along the top (columns) and age groups along the sides (rows).<br />
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>nrow</code> and <code>ncol</code> are not relevant, as the subgroups are presented in a grid</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these functions accept a formula syntax to specify the column(s) for faceting. Both accept up to two columns, one on each side of a tilde <code>~</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For <code>facet_wrap()</code> most often you will write only one column preceded by a tilde <code>~</code> like <code>facet_wrap(~hospital)</code>. However you can write two columns <code>facet_wrap(outcome ~ hospital)</code> - each unique combination will display in a separate panel, but they will not be arranged in a grid. The headings will show combined terms and these won’t be specific logic to the columns vs. rows. If you are providing only one faceting variable, a period <code>.</code> is used as a placeholder on the other side of the formula - see the code examples.</p></li>
<li><p>For <code>facet_grid()</code> you can also specify one or two columns to the formula (grid <code>rows ~ columns</code>). If you only want to specify one, you can place a period <code>.</code> on the other side of the tilde like <code>facet_grid(. ~ hospital)</code> or <code>facet_grid(hospital ~ .)</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Facets can quickly contain an overwhelming amount of information - its good to ensure you don’t have too many levels of each variable that you choose to facet by. Here are some quick examples with the malaria dataset (see <a href="download-handbook-and-data.html#download-handbook-and-data">Download handbook and data</a>) which consists of daily case counts of malaria for facilities, by age group.</p>
<p>Below we import and do some quick modifications for simplicity:</p>
<p>The first 50 rows of the malaria data are below. Note there is a column <code>malaria_tot</code>, but also columns for counts by age group (these will be used in the second, <code>facet_grid()</code> example).</p>
<div id="facet_wrap" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3><code>facet_wrap()</code></h3>
<p>For the moment, let’s focus on the columns <code>malaria_tot</code> and <code>District</code>. Ignore the age-specific count columns for now. We will plot epidemic curves with <code>geom_col()</code>, which produces a column for each day at the specified y-axis height given in column <code>malaria_tot</code> (the data are already daily counts, so we use <code>geom_col()</code> - see <a href="ggplot-basics.html#ggplot_basics_bars">the “Bar plot” section below</a>).</p>
<p>When we add the command <code>facet_wrap()</code>, we specify a tilde and then the column to facet on (<code>District</code> in this case). You can place another column on the left side of the tilde, - this will create one facet for each combination - but we recommend you do this with <code>facet_grid()</code> instead. In this use case, one facet is created for each unique value of <code>District</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="facet_grid" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3><code>facet_grid()</code></h3>
<p>We can use a <code>facet_grid()</code> approach to cross two variables. Let’s say we want to cross <code>District</code> and age. Well, we need to do some data transformations on the age columns to get these data into ggplot-preferred “long” format. The age groups all have their own columns - we want them in a single column called <code>age_group</code> and another called <code>num_cases</code>. See the page on <a href="pivoting-data.html#pivoting-data">Pivoting data</a> for more information on this process.</p>
<p>Now the first 50 rows of data look like this:</p>
<p>When you pass the two variables to <code>facet_grid()</code>, easiest is to use formula notation (e.g. <code>x ~ y</code>) where x is rows and y is columns. Here is the plot, using <code>facet_grid()</code> to show the plots for each combination of the columns <code>age_group</code> and <code>District</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="free-or-fixed-axes" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Free or fixed axes</h3>
<p>The axes scales displayed when faceting are by default the same (fixed) across all the facets. This is helpful for cross-comparison, but not always appropriate.</p>
<p>When using <code>facet_wrap()</code> or <code>facet_grid()</code>, we can add <code>scales = "free_y"</code> to “free” or release the y-axes of the panels to scale appropriately to their data subset. This is particularly useful if the actual counts are small for one of the subcategories and trends are otherwise hard to see. Instead of “free_y” we can also write “free_x” to do the same for the x-axis (e.g. for dates) or “free” for both axes. Note that in <code>facet_grid</code>, the y scales will be the same for facets in the same row, and the x scales will be the same for facets in the same column.</p>
<p>When using <code>facet_grid</code> only, we can add <code>space = "free_y"</code> or <code>space = "free_x"</code> so that the actual height or width of the facet is weighted to the values of the figure within. This only works if <code>scales = "free"</code> (y or x) is already applied.</p>

<div id="saving-plots-1" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Saving plots</h3>
<p>By default when you run a <code>ggplot()</code> command, the plot will be printed to the Plots RStudio pane. However, you can also save the plot as an object by using the assignment operator <code>&lt;-</code> and giving it a name. Then it will not print unless the object name itself is run. You can also print it by wrapping the plot name with <code>print()</code>, but this is only necessary in certain circumstances such as if the plot is created inside a <em>for loop</em> used to print multiple plots at once (see <a href="iteration-loops-and-lists.html#iteration-loops-and-lists">Iteration, loops, and lists</a> page).</p>
</div>
<div id="modifying-saved-plots" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Modifying saved plots</h3>
<p>One nice thing about <strong>ggplot2</strong> is that you can define a plot (as above), and then add layers to it starting with its name. You do not have to repeat all the commands that created the original plot!</p>
<p>For example, to modify the plot <code>age_by_wt</code> that was defined above, to include a vertical line at age 50, we would just add a <code>+</code> and begin adding additional layers to the plot.</p>
</div>
<div id="exporting-plots" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Exporting plots</h3>
<p>Exporting ggplots is made easy with the <code>ggsave()</code> function from <strong>ggplot2</strong>. It can work in two ways, either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specify the name of the plot object, then the file path and name with extension
<ul>
<li>For example: <code>ggsave(my_plot, here("plots", "my_plot.png"))</code><br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Run the command with only a file path, to save the last plot that was printed
<ul>
<li>For example: <code>ggsave(here("plots", "my_plot.png"))</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>You can export as png, pdf, jpeg, tiff, bmp, svg, or several other file types, by specifying the file extension in the file path.</p>
<p>You can also specify the arguments <code>width =</code>, <code>height =</code>, and <code>units =</code> (either “in”, “cm”, or “mm”). You can also specify <code>dpi =</code> with a number for plot resolution (e.g. 300). See the function details by entering <code>?ggsave</code> or reading the <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsave.html">documentation online</a>.</p>
<p>Remember that you can use <code>here()</code> syntax to provide the desired file path. See the <a href="import-and-export.html#import-and-export">Import and export</a> page for more information.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="labels-1" class="section level2" number="30.8">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">30.8</span> Labels</h2>
<p>Surely you will want to add or adjust the plot’s labels. These are most easily done within the <code>labs()</code> function which is added to the plot with <code>+</code> just as the geoms were.</p>
<p>Within <code>labs()</code> you can provide character strings to these arguements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>x =</code> and <code>y =</code> The x-axis and y-axis title (labels)<br />
</li>
<li><code>title =</code> The main plot title<br />
</li>
<li><code>subtitle =</code> The subtitle of the plot, in smaller text below the title<br />
</li>
<li><code>caption =</code> The caption of the plot, in bottom-right by default</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a plot we made earlier, but with nicer labels:</p>
<p>Note how in the caption assignment we used <code>str_glue()</code> from the <strong>stringr</strong> package to implant dynamic R code within the string text. The caption will show the “Data as of:” date that reflects the maximum hospitalization date in the linelist. Read more about this in the page on <a href="characters-and-strings.html#characters-and-strings">Characters and strings</a>.</p>
<p>A note on specifying the <em>legend</em> title: There is no one “legend title” argument, as you could have multiple scales in your legend. Within <code>labs()</code>, you can write the argument for the plot aesthetic used to create the legend, and provide the title this way. For example, above we assigned <code>color = age</code> to create the legend. Therefore, we provide <code>color =</code> to <code>labs()</code> and assign the legend title desired (“Age” with capital A). If you create the legend with <code>aes(fill = COLUMN)</code>, then in <code>labs()</code> you would write <code>fill =</code> to adjust the title of that legend. The section on color scales in the <a href="ggplot-tips.html#ggplot-tips">ggplot tips</a> page provides more details on editing legends, and an alternative approach using <code>scales_()</code> functions.</p>
</div>
<div id="ggplot_basics_themes" class="section level2" number="30.9">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">30.9</span> Themes</h2>
<p>One of the best parts of <strong>ggplot2</strong> is the amount of control you have over the plot - you can define anything! As mentioned above, the design of the plot that is <em>not</em> related to the data shapes/geometries are adjusted within the <code>theme()</code> function. For example, the plot background color, presence/absence of gridlines, and the font/size/color/alignment of text (titles, subtitles, captions, axis text…). These adjustments can be done in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html"><em>complete theme</em></a> <code>theme_()</code> function to make sweeping adjustments - these include <code>theme_classic()</code>, <code>theme_minimal()</code>, <code>theme_dark()</code>, <code>theme_light()</code> <code>theme_grey()</code>, <code>theme_bw()</code> among others<br />
</li>
<li>Adjust each tiny aspect of the plot individually within <code>theme()</code></li>
</ul>
<div id="complete-themes" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Complete themes</h3>
<p>As they are quite straight-forward, we will demonstrate the complete theme functions below and will not describe them further here. Note that any micro-adjustments with <code>theme()</code> should be made <em>after</em> use of a complete theme.</p>
<p>Write them with empty parentheses.</p>
</div>
<div id="modify-theme" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Modify theme</h3>
<p>The <code>theme()</code> function can take a large number of arguments, each of which edits a very specific aspect of the plot. There is no way we could cover all of the arguments, but we will describe the general pattern for them and show you how to find the argument name that you need. The basic syntax is this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Within <code>theme()</code> write the argument name for the plot element you want to edit, like <code>plot.title =</code><br />
</li>
<li>Provide an <code>element_()</code> function to the argument<br />
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Most often, use <code>element_text()</code>, but others include <code>element_rect()</code> for canvas background colors, or <code>element_blank()</code> to remove plot elements<br />
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Within the <code>element_()</code> function, write argument assignments to make the fine adjustments you desire</li>
</ol>
<p>So, that description was quite abstract, so here are some examples.</p>
<p>The below plot looks quite silly, but it serves to show you a variety of the ways you can adjust your plot.</p>
<ul>
<li>We begin with the plot <code>age_by_wt</code> defined just above and add <code>theme_classic()</code><br />
</li>
<li>For finer adjustments we add <code>theme()</code> and include one argument for each plot element to adjust</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be nice to organize the arguments in logical sections. To describe just some of those used below:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>legend.position =</code> is unique in that it accepts simple values like “bottom”, “top”, “left”, and “right”. But generally, text-related arguments require that you place the details <em>within</em> <code>element_text()</code>.<br />
</li>
<li>Title size with <code>element_text(size = 30)</code><br />
</li>
<li>The caption horizontal alignment with <code>element_text(hjust = 0)</code> (from right to left)<br />
</li>
<li>The subtitle is italicized with <code>element_text(face = "italic")</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some especially common <code>theme()</code> arguments. You will recognize some patterns, such as appending <code>.x</code> or <code>.y</code> to apply the change only to one axis.</p>

<p>But there are so many theme arguments! How could I remember them all? Do not worry - it is impossible to remember them all. Luckily there are a few tools to help you:</p>

<p><span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong><em>TIP:</em></strong> Run <code>theme_get()</code> from <strong>ggplot2</strong> to print a list of all 90+ <code>theme()</code> arguments to the console.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong><em>TIP:</em></strong> If you ever want to remove an element of a plot, you can also do it through <code>theme()</code>. Just pass <code>element_blank()</code> to an argument to have it disappear completely. For legends, set <code>legend.position = "none".</code></span></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">30.12</span> Plot continuous data</h2>
<p>Throughout this page, you have already seen many examples of plotting continuous data. Here we briefly consolidate these and present a few variations.<br />
Visualisations covered here include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plots for one continuous variable:
<ul>
<li><strong>Histogram</strong>, a classic graph to present the distribution of a continuous variable.</li>
<li><strong>Box plot</strong> (also called box and whisker), to show the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, tail ends of the distribution, and outliers (<a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/boxplot.html">important limitations</a>).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Jitter plot</strong>, to show all values as points that are ‘jittered’ so they can (mostly) all be seen, even where two have the same value.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Violin plot</strong>, show the distribution of a continuous variable based on the symmetrical width of the ‘violin’.</li>
<li><strong>Sina plot</strong>, are a combination of jitter and violin plots, where individual points are shown but in the symmetrical shape of the distribution (via <strong>ggforce</strong> package).<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Scatter plot</strong> for two continuous variables.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Heat plots</strong> for three continuous variables (linked to <a href="heat-plots.html#heat-plots">Heat plots</a> page)</li>
</ul>
<div id="histograms" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Histograms</h3>
<p>Histograms may look like bar charts, but are distinct because they measure the distribution of a <em>continuous</em> variable. There are no spaces between the “bars”, and only one column is provided to <code>geom_histogram()</code>.</p>
<p>Below is code for generating <strong>histograms</strong>, which group continuous data into ranges and display in adjacent bars of varying height. This is done using <code>geom_histogram()</code>. See the <a href="ggplot-basics.html#ggplot_basics_bars">“Bar plot” section</a> of the ggplot basics page to understand difference between <code>geom_histogram()</code>, <code>geom_bar()</code>, and <code>geom_col()</code>.</p>
<p>We will show the distribution of ages of cases. Within <code>mapping = aes()</code> specify which column you want to see the distribution of. You can assign this column to either the x or the y axis.</p>
<p>The rows will be assigned to “bins” based on their numeric age, and these bins will be graphically represented by bars. If you specify a number of bins with the <code>bins =</code> plot aesthetic, the break points are evenly spaced between the minimum and maximum values of the histogram. If <code>bins =</code> is unspecified, an appropriate number of bins will be guessed and this message displayed after the plot:</p>
<pre><code>## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.</code></pre>
<p>If you do not want to specify a number of bins to <code>bins =</code>, you could alternatively specify <code>binwidth =</code> in the units of the axis. We give a few examples showing different bins and bin widths:</p>
<p>To get smoothed proportions, you can use <code>geom_density()</code>:</p>
<p>To get a “stacked” histogram (of a continuous column of data), you can do one of the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Use <code>geom_histogram()</code> with the <code>fill =</code> argument within <code>aes()</code> and assigned to the grouping column, or<br />
</li>
<li>Use <code>geom_freqpoly()</code>, which is likely easier to read (you can still set <code>binwidth =</code>)<br />
</li>
<li>To see proportions of all values, set the <code>y = after_stat(density)</code> (use this syntax exactly - not changed for your data). Note: these proportions will show <em>per group</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each is shown below (*note use of <code>color =</code> vs. <code>fill =</code> in each):</p>
<p>If you want to have some fun, try <code>geom_density_ridges</code> from the <strong>ggridges</strong> package (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html">vignette here</a>.</p>
<p>Read more in detail about histograms at the <strong>tidyverse</strong> <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_histogram.html">page on geom_histogram()</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="box-plots" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Box plots</h3>
<p>Box plots are common, but have important limitations. They can obscure the actual distribution - e.g. a bi-modal distribution. See this <a href="https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/boxplot.html">R graph gallery</a> and this <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/boxplot.html">data-to-viz article</a> for more details. However, they do nicely display the inter-quartile range and outliers - so they can be overlaid on top of other types of plots that show the distribution in more detail.</p>
<p>Below we remind you of the various components of a boxplot:</p>
<p>When using <code>geom_boxplot()</code> to create a box plot, you generally map only one axis (x or y) within <code>aes()</code>. The axis specified determines if the plots are horizontal or vertical.</p>
<p>In most geoms, you create a plot per group by mapping an aesthetic like <code>color =</code> or <code>fill =</code> to a column within <code>aes()</code>. However, for box plots achieve this by assigning the grouping column to the un-assigned axis (x or y). Below is code for a boxplot of <em>all</em> age values in the dataset, and second is code to display one box plot for each (non-missing) gender in the dataset. Note that <code>NA</code> (missing) values will appear as a separate box plot unless removed. In this example we also set the <code>fill</code> to the column <code>outcome</code> so each plot is a different color - but this is not necessary.</p>
<p>For code to add a box plot to the edges of a scatter plot (“marginal” plots) see the page <a href="ggplot-tips.html#ggplot-tips">ggplot tips</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="violin-jitter-and-sina-plots" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Violin, jitter, and sina plots</h3>
<p>Below is code for creating <strong>violin plots</strong> (<code>geom_violin</code>) and <strong>jitter plots</strong> (<code>geom_jitter</code>) to show distributions. You can specify that the fill or color is also determined by the data, by inserting these options within <code>aes()</code>.</p>
<p>You can combine the two using the <code>geom_sina()</code> function from the <strong>ggforce</strong> package. The sina plots the jitter points in the shape of the violin plot. When overlaid on the violin plot (adjusting the transparencies) this can be easier to visually interpret.</p>
</div>
<div id="two-continuous-variables" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Two continuous variables</h3>
<p>Following similar syntax, <code>geom_point()</code> will allow you to plot two continuous variables against each other in a <strong>scatter plot</strong>. This is useful for showing actual values rather than their distributions. A basic scatter plot of age vs weight is shown in (A). In (B) we again use <code>facet_grid()</code> to show the relationship between two continuous variables in the linelist.</p>
</div>
<div id="three-continuous-variables" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Three continuous variables</h3>
<p>You can display three continuous variables by utilizing the <code>fill =</code> argument to create a <em>heat plot</em>. The color of each “cell” will reflect the value of the third continuous column of data. See the <a href="ggplot-tips.html#ggplot-tips">ggplot tips</a> page and the page on on <a href="heat-plots.html#heat-plots">Heat plots</a> for more details and several examples.</p>
<p>There are ways to make 3D plots in R, but for applied epidemiology these are often difficult to interpret and therefore less useful for decision-making.</p>

<div id="plot-categorical-data" class="section level2" number="30.13">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">30.13</span> Plot categorical data</h2>
<p>Categorical data can be character values, could be logical (TRUE/FALSE), or factors (see the <a href="factors.html#factors">Factors</a> page).</p>
<div id="preparation-22" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<div id="data-structure" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Data structure</h4>
<p>The first thing to understand about your categorical data is whether it exists as raw observations like a linelist of cases, or as a summary or aggregate data frame that holds counts or proportions. The state of your data will impact which plotting function you use:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your data are raw observations with one row per observation, you will likely use <code>geom_bar()</code><br />
</li>
<li>If your data are already aggregated into counts or proportions, you will likely use <code>geom_col()</code></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="column-class-and-value-ordering" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Column class and value ordering</h4>
<p>Next, examine the class of the columns you want to plot. We look at <code>hospital</code>, first with <code>class()</code> from <strong>base</strong> R, and with <code>tabyl()</code> from <strong>janitor</strong>.</p>
<p>We can see the values within are characters, as they are hospital names, and by default they are ordered alphabetically. There are ‘other’ and ‘missing’ values, which we would prefer to be the last subcategories when presenting breakdowns. So we change this column into a factor and re-order it. This is covered in more detail in the <a href="factors.html#factors">Factors</a> page.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="ggplot_basics_bars" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3><code>geom_bar()</code></h3>
<p>Use <code>geom_bar()</code> if you want bar height (or the height of stacked bar components) to reflect <em>the number of relevant rows in the data</em>. These bars will have gaps between them, unless the <code>width =</code> plot aesthetic is adjusted.</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide only one axis column assignment (typically x-axis). If you provide x and y, you will get <code>Error: stat_count() can only have an x or y aesthetic.</code><br />
</li>
<li>You can create stacked bars by adding a <code>fill =</code> column assignment within <code>mapping = aes()</code><br />
</li>
<li>The opposite axis will be titled “count” by default, because it represents the number of rows</li>
</ul>
<p>Below, we have assigned outcome to the y-axis, but it could just as easily be on the x-axis. If you have longer character values, it can sometimes look better to flip the bars sideways and put the legend on the bottom. This may impact how your factor levels are ordered - in this case we reverse them with <code>fct_rev()</code> to put missing and other at the bottom.</p>
</div>
<div id="geom_col" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3><code>geom_col()</code></h3>
<p>Use <code>geom_col()</code> if you want bar height (or height of stacked bar components) to reflect pre-calculated <em>values</em> that exists in the data. Often, these are summary or “aggregated” counts, or proportions.</p>
<p>Provide column assignments for <em>both</em> axes to <code>geom_col()</code>. Typically your x-axis column is discrete and your y-axis column is numeric.</p>
<p>Let’s say we have this dataset <code>outcomes</code>:</p>
<p>Below is code using <code>geom_col</code> for creating simple bar charts to show the distribution of Ebola patient outcomes. With geom_col, both x and y need to be specified. Here x is the categorical variable along the x axis, and y is the generated proportions column <code>proportion</code>.</p>
<p>To show breakdowns by hospital, we would need our table to contain more information, and to be in “long” format. We create this table with the frequencies of the combined categories <code>outcome</code> and <code>hospital</code> (see <a href="grouping-data.html#grouping-data">Grouping data</a> page for grouping tips).</p>
<p>We then create the ggplot with some added formatting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Axis flip</strong>: Swapped the axis around with <code>coord_flip()</code> so that we can read the hospital names.</li>
<li><strong>Columns side-by-side</strong>: Added a <code>position = "dodge"</code> argument so that the bars for death and recover are presented side by side rather than stacked. Note stacked bars are the default.</li>
<li><strong>Column width</strong>: Specified ‘width’, so the columns are half as thin as the full possible width.</li>
<li><strong>Column order</strong>: Reversed the order of the categories on the y axis so that ‘Other’ and ‘Missing’ are at the bottom, with <code>scale_x_discrete(limits=rev)</code>. Note that we used that rather than <code>scale_y_discrete</code> because hospital is stated in the <code>x</code> argument of <code>aes()</code>, even if visually it is on the y axis. We do this because Ggplot seems to present categories backwards unless we tell it not to.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Other details</strong>: Labels/titles and colours added within <code>labs</code> and <code>scale_fill_color</code> respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the proportions are binary, so we may prefer to drop ‘recover’ and just show the proportion who died. This is just for illustration purposes.</p>
<p>If using <code>geom_col()</code> with dates data (e.g. an epicurve from aggregated data) - you will want to adjust the <code>width =</code> argument to remove the “gap” lines between the bars. If using daily data set <code>width = 1</code>. If weekly, <code>width = 7</code>. Months are not possible because each month has a different number of days.</p>
</div>
<div id="geom_histogram" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3><code>geom_histogram()</code></h3>
<p>Histograms may look like bar charts, but are distinct because they measure the distribution of a <em>continuous</em> variable. There are no spaces between the “bars”, and only one column is provided to <code>geom_histogram()</code>. There are arguments specific to histograms such as <code>bin_width =</code> and <code>breaks =</code> to specify how the data should be binned. The section above on continuous data and the page on <a href="epidemic-curves.html#epidemic-curves">Epidemic curves</a> provide additional detail.</p>
