Notice names input output objects correspond exactly ui.understand basics server reacts user inputs, note output know (underlying package) inputs change, rerun function create plot every time change. Note also use renderPlot() function - one family class specific functions pass objects output. number functions behave similar, need ensure function matches class object ’re passing ui! example:renderText() - send text uirenderDataTable - send interactive table ui.Remember need match output function used ui - renderPlot() paired plotOutput(), renderText() matched textOutput().’ve finally made functioning app! can run pressing Run App button top right script window Rstudio.

Lets continue build existing app adding extra features. things nice add :explanatory textA download button plot - provide user high quality version image ’re generating appA selector specific facilities, maybe one dates wellAnother dashboard page - show summary statistics full scope data.lot add, can use learn bunch different shiny featues way. much learn shiny (can get advanced, hopefully case users better idea use can become comfortable using external learning sources well).ADD SECTION ADDING TEXT p() etc.Lets move second three features. download button fairly common thing add app fairly easy make. need add another Widget ui, need add another output server attach . can also introduce reactive conductors example!Lets update ui first - easy shiny comes widget called downloadButton() - lets give inputId label.Note ’ve also added hr() tag - adds horizontal line separating control widgets download widgets. another one HTML tags discussed previously.Now ui ready, need add server component. Downloads done server downloadHandler() function. Similar plot, need attach output inputId download button. function takes two arguments - filename content - functions. might able guess, filename used specify name downloaded file, content used specify downloaded. content contain function use save data locally - downloading csv file use rio::export(). Since ’re downloading plot, ’ll use ggplot2::ggsave(). Lets look program (won’t add server yet).Note content function always takes file argument, put output file name specified. might also notice ’re repeating code - using plot_epicurve() function twice server, download image displayed app. wont massively affect performance, means code generate plot run user changes widgets specifying district age group, want download plot. larger apps, suboptimal decisions like one slow things , ’s good learn make app efficient sense. make sense way run epicurve code districts/age groups changes, let used renderPlot() downloadHandler() functions. reactive conductors come !Reactive conductors objects created shiny server reactive way, outputted - can just used parts server. number different kinds reactive conductors, ’ll go basic two.1.reactive() - basic reactive conductor - react whenever inputs used inside change (district/age group widgets)\r\n2. eventReactive()- rective conductor works reactive(), except user can specify inputs cause rerun. useful reactive conductor takes long time process, explained later.Lets look two examples:use eventReactive() setup, can specify inputs cause chunk code run - isn’t useful us moment, can leave now. Note can include multiple inputs c()Lets look can integrate server code:can see ’re just calling output reactive ’ve defined download plot rendering functions. One thing note often trips people use outputs reactives functions - must add empty brackets end (.e. malaria_plot() correct, malaria_plot ). Now ’ve added solution app little tidyer, faster, easier change since code runs epicurve function one place.
