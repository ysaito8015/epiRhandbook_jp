# This book strives to:

* Serve as a quick reference manual - not as a textbook or comprehensive R training
* Address common epidemiological problems via task-centered examples
* Be accessible in settings with low internet-connectivity via an offline version (instructions below)

# What challenges does this book try to address?

* Many epidemiologists are transitioning to R from SAS, STATA, SPSS, Excel, or other software
* Epidemiologists should not need to spend hours searching online for code relevant to the common epi user
* Epidemiologists sometimes work in low internet-connectivity environments and have limited support

# How is this different than other R books?

* It is written by epidemiologists, for epidemiologists - leveraging experience in local, national, academic, and emergency settings
* It provides examples of epidemic curves, transmission chains, epidemic modeling and projections, age and sex pyramids and standardization, record matching, outbreak detection, survey analysis, causal diagrams, survival analysis, GIS basics, phylogenetic trees, automated reports, etc…
