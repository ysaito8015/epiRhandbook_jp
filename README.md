**The problem:**  

* Field epidemiologists often work in low internet-connectivity environments and have limited technical support from HQ  
* Epis learning or new to R often must Google and skim dozens of forum pages to complete common data manipulation and visualization epi tasks  
* Most online R help resources are not task-centered nor epidemiology-focused  

**The solution:**  

* An offline "handbook" or "reference book", consisting of task-centered pages which coach a user through common epidemiological tasks with easily-modifiable code examples

**Guiding principles:**  

* Pages have consistent structure, e.g. problem statement, dataset(s) at start, solutions (with code), outputs, links to other relevant pages
* Pages are heavily annotated in basic language and, when relevant, display step-by-step transformations of datasets and graphics
* Pages can present multiple ways to solve each task, with emphasis on packages and solutions that are stable and simple

**Methods:**  

*The Pages:*
* Pages will be HTML (produced by Rmarkdown). Allows tabs, gifs, links, references, embedded files, etc. Still viewable offline.

*A living document:*  

* Code hosted on Github repository
* Users can download latest handbook version from Github or R4Epis website, can email it to friends and co-workers
* Since optimal R code for a task frequently changes, additional pages and updates could be crowdsourced
