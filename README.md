The problem:

* Field epidemiologists often work in low internet-connectivity environments and have limited technical support from HQ
* Epis learning or new to R often must Google and skim dozens of forum pages to complete common data manipulation and visualization epi tasks
* Most online R help resources are not task-centered nor epidemiology-focused

Our objective:

* **To make available a handbook covering common epidemiological tasks and outputs, with clear explanations, step-by-step instructions, and code examples.** We are not looking to reinvent the “how to learn R” wheel, but rather to be a reference book specifically for epidemiologists, which, if needed, can be downloaded offline and used in a setting or field deployment with poor/no internet access.

Audiences:

*Primary audience: Field epis and applied epidemiologists - urgently needing R code to modify in order to execute a task*
* Those learning R and code-based workflows
* Those who know other software (STATA, SAS…) but need equivalent code in R
* Those working in poor-connectivity environments where extensive Google searching may be frustrating or impossible
* …with written language that is simple and can be understood by non-native English speakers

*Secondary audience: Research, Governmental, and University epidemiologists, particularly:*
* Those at institutions transitioning to using R
