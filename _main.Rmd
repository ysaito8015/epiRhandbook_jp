<!-- ======================================================= -->
## About this handbook {-}

This is a free open-access R reference guide intended for applied epidemiologists.  

**This book strives to:**  

* Serve as a quick reference guide - not a textbook  
* Address common epidemiological problems via task-centered examples  
* Be accessible in settings with limited technical support and low internet-connectivity (downloadable version)  
* Contain clear and simple language, with step-by-step instructions and many comments  
* Be a living document, growing and adapting to new best practices  

**What gaps does this book address?**  

* Many epidemiologists do not have formal training in R or data science, or are transitioning to R from SAS, STATA, or other statistical software.  
* The R universe changes frequently - there should be a place for best practice code catered toward the common epidemiologist user.  
* Epidemiologists often must read dozens of online forum pages for answers, most of which are not epidemiology-oriented.  
* Some epidemiologists work in low internet-connectivity environments and have limited technical support.  

**How is this different than other R books?**  

This handbook is written by epidemiologists, for epidemiologists. Examples are taken from lived experience in local, national, academic, and emergency settings. The book is also offered in a download-able format for to bring into settings with unreliable internet. 
In addition to core R concepts and tools, this book covers:  

* epidemic curves  
* transmission chains and epidemic modeling  
* age and sex pyramids  
* age and sex standardization  
* probabilistic matching of records on name similarity, age, sex, birthdate, etc.  
* outbreak detection methods  
* survey analysis  
* causal diagrams  
* survival analysis  
* GIS basics  
* phylogenetic trees  
* missing data imputation  
* automated routine reports with Rmarkdown

## Flow diagrams {.tabset .tabset-fade}

One can use the R package **DiagrammeR** to create charts/flow charts. They can be static, or they can adjust somewhat dynamically based on changes in a dataset.  

**Tools**  

The function `grViz()` is used to create a "Graphviz" diagram. This function accepts a *character string input containing instructions* for making the diagram. Within that string, the instructions are written in a different language, called [DOT](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html) - it is quite easy to learn the basics.  

**Basic structure**  

1) Open the instructions `grViz("`  
2) Specify directionality and name of the graph, and open brackets, e.g. `digraph my_flow_chart {`
3) Graph statement (layout, rank direction)  
4) Nodes statements (create nodes)
5) Edges statements (gives links between nodes)  
6) Close the instructions `}")`  

### Simple examples  
<h3> Simple examples </h3>

Below are two simple examples  

A very minimal example:  

```{r out.width='50%'}
# A minimal plot
DiagrammeR::grViz("digraph {
  
graph[layout = dot, rankdir = LR]

a
b
c

a -> b -> c
}")
```

An example with applied public health context:  

```{r out.width='50%'}
grViz("                           # All instructions are within a large character string
digraph surveillance_diagram {    # 'digraph' means 'directional graph', then the graph name 
  
  # graph statement
  #################
  graph [layout = dot,
         rankdir = TB,
         overlap = true,
         fontsize = 10]
  
  # nodes
  #######
  node [shape = circle,           # shape = circle
       fixedsize = true
       width = 1.3]               # width of circles
  
  Primary                         # names of nodes
  Secondary
  Tertiary

  # edges
  #######
  Primary   -> Secondary [label = 'case transfer']
  Secondary -> Tertiary [label = 'case transfer']
}
")
```

### Syntax  

**Basic syntax**  

Node names, or edge statements, can be separated with spaces, semicolons, or newlines.  

**Rank direction**  

A plot can be re-oriented to move left-to-right by adjusting the `rankdir` argument within the graph statement. The default is TB (top-to-bottom), but it can be LR (left-to-right), RL, or BT.  

**Node names**  

Node names can be single words, as in the simple example above. To use multi-word names or special characters (e.g. parentheses, dashes), put the node name within single quotes (' '). It may be easier to have a short node name, and assign a *label*, as shown below within brackets [ ]. A label is also necessary to have a newline within the node name - use `\n` in the node label within single quotes, as shown below.  

**Subgroups**  
Within edge statements, subgroups can be created on either side of the edge with curly brackets ({ }). The edge then applies to all nodes in the bracket - it is a shorthand.  


**Layouts**  

* dot (set `rankdir` to either TB, LR, RL, BT, )
* neato  
* twopi  
* circo  


**Nodes - editable attributes**  

* `label` (text, in single quotes if multi-word)  
* `fillcolor` (many possible colors)  
* `fontcolor`  
* `alpha` (transparency 0-1)  
* `shape` (ellipse, oval, diamond, egg, plaintext, point, square, triangle)  
* `style`  
* `sides`  
* `peripheries`  
* `fixedsize` (h x w)  
* `height`  
* `width`  
* `distortion`  
* `penwidth` (width of shape border)  
* `x` (displacement left/right)  
* `y` (displacement up/down)  
* `fontname`  
* `fontsize`  
* `icon`  


**Edges - editable attributes**  

* `arrowsize`  
* `arrowhead` (normal, box, crow, curve, diamond, dot, inv, none, tee, vee)  
* `arrowtail`  
* `dir` (direction, )  
* `style` (dashed, ...)  
* `color`  
* `alpha`  
* `headport` (text in front of arrowhead)  
* `tailport` (text in behind arrowtail)  
* `fontname`  
* `fontsize`  
* `fontcolor`  
* `penwidth` (width of arrow)  
* `minlen` (minimum length)

**Color names**: hexadecimal values or 'X11' color names, see [here for X11 details](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/graphviz_and_mermaid.html) 


### Complex examples  

The example below expands on the surveillance_diagram, adding complex node names, grouped edges, colors and styling

}
")
```


```{r out.width='50%', echo=F}

                                      style = dashed]
}
")
```

**Sub-graph clusters**  

To group nodes into boxed clusters, put them within the same named subgraph (`subgraph name {}`). To have each subgraph identified within a bounding box, begin the name of the subgraph with "cluster", as shown with the 4 boxes below.  

```
DiagrammeR::grViz("             # All instructions are within a large character string
digraph surveillance_diagram {  # 'digraph' means 'directional graph', then the graph name

**node shapes**  

The example below, borrowed from [this tutorial](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/), shows applied node shapes, and shows a shorthand for serial edge connections  

```{r out.width='75%'}
DiagrammeR::grViz("digraph {

graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]

# define the global styles of the nodes. We can override these in box if we wish
node [shape = rectangle, style = filled, fillcolor = Linen]

data1 [label = 'Dataset 1', shape = folder, fillcolor = Beige]
data2 [label = 'Dataset 2', shape = folder, fillcolor = Beige]
process [label =  'Process \n Data']
statistical [label = 'Statistical \n Analysis']
results [label= 'Results']

# edge definitions with the node IDs
{data1 data2}  -> process -> statistical -> results
}")
```


### Outputs  

How to handle and save outputs  

* Outputs will appear in RStudio's Viewer pane, by default in the lower-right alongside Files, Plots, Packages, and Help.  
* To export you can "Save as image" or "Copy to clipboard" from the Viewer. The graphic will adjust to the specified size.  




### Parameterized figures  
<h3> Parameterized figures </h3>

"Parameterized figures: A great benefit of designing figures within R is that we are able to connect the figures directly with our analysis by reading R values directly into our flowcharts. For example, suppose you have created a filtering process which removes values after each stage of a process, you can have a figure show the number of values left in the dataset after each stage of your process. To do this we, you can use the @@X symbol directly within the figure, then refer to this in the footer of the plot using [X]:, where X is the a unique numeric index. Here is a basic example:"  
https://mikeyharper.uk/flowcharts-in-r-using-diagrammer/

```{r, eval=F}
# Define some sample data
data <- list(a=1000, b=800, c=600, d=400)


DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph graph2 {

graph [layout = dot]

# node definitions with substituted label text
node [shape = rectangle, width = 4, fillcolor = Biege]
a [label = '@@1']
b [label = '@@2']
c [label = '@@3']
d [label = '@@4']

a -> b -> c -> d

}

[1]:  paste0('Raw Data (n = ', data$a, ')')
[2]: paste0('Remove Errors (n = ', data$b, ')')
[3]: paste0('Identify Potential Customers (n = ', data$c, ')')
[4]: paste0('Select Top Priorities (n = ', data$d, ')')
")

```

## Alluvial/Sankey Diagrams {.tabset .tabset-fade}

### Preparation  

**Load packages**  

```{r}
pacman::p_load(networkD3)
```

### Plotting from dataset  

Plotting the connections in a dataset  


https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/321-introduction-to-interactive-sankey-diagram-2.html

Counts of age category and hospital, relabled as target and source, respectively.  

```{r}
# counts by hospital and age category
links <- linelist %>% 
  select(hospital, age_cat) %>%
  count(hospital, age_cat) %>% 
  rename(source = hospital,
         target = age_cat)
```


```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
DT::datatable(head(links, 30), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T))
```

Now formalize the nodes list, and adjust the ID columns to be numbers instead of labels:  


```{r}
# The unique node names
nodes <- data.frame(
  name=c(as.character(links$source), as.character(links$target)) %>% 
    unique()
  )

# match to numbers, not names
links$IDsource <- match(links$source, nodes$name)-1 
links$IDtarget <- match(links$target, nodes$name)-1
```

Now plot the Sankey diagram:  

```{r}

# plot
######
p <- sankeyNetwork(Links = links,
                   Nodes = nodes,
                   Source = "IDsource",
                   Target = "IDtarget",
                   Value = "n",
                   NodeID = "name",
                   units = "TWh",
                   fontSize = 12,
                   nodeWidth = 30)
p
```



Here is an example where the patient Outome is included as well. Note in the data management step how we bind rows of counts of hospital -> outcome, using the same column names.   

```{r}
# counts by hospital and age category
links <- linelist %>% 
  select(hospital, age_cat) %>%
  mutate(age_cat = stringr::str_glue("Age {age_cat}")) %>% 
  count(hospital, age_cat) %>% 
  rename(source = age_cat,
         target = hospital) %>% 
  bind_rows(
    linelist %>% 
      select(hospital, outcome) %>% 
      count(hospital, outcome) %>% 
      rename(source = hospital,
             target = outcome)
  )

# The unique node names
nodes <- data.frame(
  name=c(as.character(links$source), as.character(links$target)) %>% 
    unique()
  )

# match to numbers, not names
links$IDsource <- match(links$source, nodes$name)-1 
links$IDtarget <- match(links$target, nodes$name)-1

# plot
######
p <- sankeyNetwork(Links = links,
                   Nodes = nodes,
                   Source = "IDsource",
                   Target = "IDtarget",
                   Value = "n",
                   NodeID = "name",
                   units = "TWh",
                   fontSize = 12,
                   nodeWidth = 30)
p

## Event timelines {.tabset .tabset-fade}

To make a timeline showing specific events, you can use the `vistime` package.

See this [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vistime/vignettes/vistime-vignette.html#ex.-2-project-planning)

```{r}
# load package
pacman::p_load(vistime,  # make the timeline
               plotly    # for interactive visualization
               )
```

```{r, echo=F}
# reference: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vistime/vignettes/vistime-vignette.html#ex.-2-project-planning

data <- read.csv(text="event, group, start, end, color
                       Event 1, Group A,2020-01-22,2020-01-22, #90caf9
                       Event 1, Group B,2020-01-23,2020-01-23, #90caf9
                       Event 1, Group C,2020-01-23,2020-01-23, #1565c0
                       Event 1, Group D,2020-01-25,2020-01-25, #f44336
                       Event 1, Group E,2020-01-25,2020-01-25, #90caf9
                       Event 1, Group F,2020-01-26,2020-01-26, #8d6e63
                       Event 1, Group G,2020-01-27,2020-01-27, #1565c0
                       Event 1, Group H,2020-01-27,2020-01-27, #90caf9
                       Event 1, Group I,2020-01-27,2020-01-27,#90a4ae
                       Event 2, Group A,2020-01-28,2020-01-28,#fc8d62
                       Event 2, Group C,2020-01-28,2020-01-28, #6a3d9a
                       Event 2, Group J,2020-01-28,2020-01-28, #90caf9
                       Event 2, Group J,2020-01-28,2020-01-28, #fc8d62
                       Event 2, Group J,2020-01-28,2020-01-28, #1565c0
")
```

Here is the events dataset we begin with:  

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
DT::datatable(data, rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T))
```



```{r}
p <- vistime(data)    # apply vistime

library(plotly)

# step 1: transform into a list
pp <- plotly_build(p)

# step 2: Marker size
for(i in 1:length(pp$x$data)){
  if(pp$x$data[[i]]$mode == "markers") pp$x$data[[i]]$marker$size <- 10
}

# step 3: text size
for(i in 1:length(pp$x$data)){
  if(pp$x$data[[i]]$mode == "text") pp$x$data[[i]]$textfont$size <- 10
}


# step 4: text position
for(i in 1:length(pp$x$data)){
  if(pp$x$data[[i]]$mode == "text") pp$x$data[[i]]$textposition <- "right"
}

#print
pp

```

## DAGs {.tabset .tabset-fade}

You can build a DAG manually using the **DiagammeR** package and DOT language, as described in another tab. Alternatively, there are packages like **ggdag** and **daggity**

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggdag/vignettes/intro-to-dags.html
