<!-- ======================================================= -->
## About this handbook {-}

<span style="color: brown;">**This is a free open-access R reference manual for applied epidemiologists and public health practitioners.**</span>

**This book strives to:**  

* Serve as a quick reference manual - not as a textbook or comprehensive R training  
* Address common epidemiological problems via task-centered examples  
* Be accessible in settings with low internet-connectivity via this (**[downloadable version**](https://github.com/nsbatra/Epi_R_handbook/tree/master/offline_long))  

**What gaps does this book address?**  

* Many epidemiologists are transitioning to R from SAS, STATA, SPSS, Excel, or other software  
* Let's avoid hours of online searching and have a repository for best-practice code for the common epi user  
* Epidemiologists sometimes work in low internet-connectivity environments and have limited support  

**How is this different than other R books?**  

* Written by epidemiologists, for epidemiologists - leveraging experience in local, national, academic, and emergency settings  
* Provides examples of epidemic curves, transmission chains, epidemic modeling and projections, age and sex pyramids and standardization, record matching, outbreak detection, survey analysis, causal diagrams, survival analysis, GIS basics, phylogenetic trees, automated reports, etc...

# Transition to R { }  

Below, we provide some advice and resources if you are transitioning to R from another statistical language.

## From Stata  
<!-- ======================================================= -->

**Coming to R from Stata**  

Many epidemiologists are first taught how to use Stata, and it can seem daunting to move into R. However, if you are a comfortable Stata user then the jump into R is certainly more manageable than you might think. While there are some key differences between Stata and R in how data can be created and modified, as well as how analysis functions are implemented – after learning these key differences you will be able to translate your skills.

Below are some key translations between Stata and R, which may be handy as your review this guide.


**General notes**

**STATA**                    | **R**  
---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------    
You can only view and manipulate one dataset at a time | You can view and manipulate multiple datasets at the same time, therefore you will frequently have to specify your dataset within the code
Online community available through [https://www.statalist.org/](https://www.statalist.org/) | Online community available through [RStudio](https://community.rstudio.com/), [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r), and [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)
Point and click functionality as an option | Minimal point and click functionality
Help for commands available by `help [command]` | Help available by `[function]?` or search in the Help pane
Comment code using * or /// or  /* TEXT */ | Comment code using #
Almost all commands are built-in to Stata. New/user-written functions can be installed as **ado** files using **ssc install** [package] | R installs with **base** functions, but typical use involves installing other packages from CRAN (see page on [R basics])
Analysis is usually written in a **do** file | Analysis written in an R script in the RStudio source pane. R markdown scripts are an alternative.


**Working directory**  

**STATA**                        | **R**  
-------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------
Working directories involve absolute filepaths (e.g. "C:/usename/documents/projects/data/")| Working directories can be either absolute, or relative to a project root folder by using the **here** package (see [Import and export]) 
See current working directory with **pwd** | Use `getwd()` or `here()` (if using the **here** package), with empty parentheses 
Set working directory with **cd** “folder location” | Use `setwd(“folder location”)`, or `set_here("folder location)` (if using **here** package)

**Importing and viewing data**  

**STATA**                    | **R**  
-------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------
Specific commands per file type | Use `import()` from **rio** package for almost all filetypes. Specific functions exist as alternatives (see [Import and export])
Reading in csv files is done by **import delimited** “filename.csv” | Use `import("filename.csv")`
Reading in xslx files is done by **import excel** “filename.xlsx” | Use `import("filename.xlsx")`
Browse your data in a new window using the command **browse** | View a dataset in the RStudio source pane using `View(dataset)`. *You need to specify your dataset name to the function in R because multiple datasets can be held at the same time. Note capital "V" in this function*
Get a high-level overview of your dataset using **summarize**, which provides the variable names and basic information | Get a high-level overview of your dataset using `summary(dataset)`

**Basic data manipulation**  

**STATA**                    | **R**  
-------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------
Dataset columns are often referred to as "variables" | More often referred to as "columns" or sometimes as "vectors" or "variables"
No need to specify the dataset | In each of the below commands, you need to specify the dataset - see the page on [Cleaning data] for examples
New variables are created using the command **generate** *varname* =  | Generate new variables using the function `mutate(varname = )`. See page on [Cleaning data] for details on all the below **dplyr** functions.
Variables are renamed using **rename** *old_name new_name* | Columns can be renamed using the function `rename(new_name = old_name)`
Variables are dropped using **drop** *varname* | Columns can be removed using the function `select()` with the column name in the parentheses following a minus sign
Factor variables can be labeled using a series of commands such as **label define** | Labeling values can done by converting the column to Factor class and specifying levels. See page on [Factors]. Column names are not typically labeled as they are in Stata.

**Descriptive analysis**  

**STATA**                    | **R**  
-------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------
Tabulate counts of a variable using **tab** *varname* | Provide the dataset and column name to `table()` such as `table(dataset$colname)`. Alternatively, use `count(varname)` from the **dplyr** package, as explained in [Grouping data]
Cross-tabulaton of two variables in a 2x2 table is done with **tab** *varname1 varname2* | Use `table(dataset$varname1, dataset$varname2` or `count(varname1, varname2)`


While this list gives an overview of the basics in translating Stata commands into R, it is not exhaustive. There are many other great resources for Stata users transitioning to R that could be of interest:

## From SAS  
<!-- ======================================================= -->

Under construction  



## Data interoperability  
<!-- ======================================================= -->

See the [Import and export] page for details on how the R package **rio** can import and export files such as STATA .dta files, SAS .xpt and.sas7bdat files, SPSS .por and.sav files, and many others.  



```{r include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}

# clear workspace

#lapply(names(sessionInfo()$loadedOnly), require, character.only = TRUE)
#invisible(lapply(paste0('package:', names(sessionInfo()$otherPkgs)), detach, character.only=TRUE, unload=TRUE, force=TRUE))

# to ensure that tidyverse packages prevail
filter <- dplyr::filter
select <- dplyr::select
summarise <- dplyr::summarise
summary <- base::summary

#load core packages
pacman::p_load(
     rio,
     here,
     DT,
     stringr,
     lubridate,
     tidyverse
)

# import the cleaned ebola linelist
linelist <- rio::import(here::here("data", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))

# import the count data - facility level
#count_data <- rio::import(here::here("data", "facility_count_data.rds"))
```
