<!-- ======================================================= -->
## About this handbook {-}

<span style="color: brown;">**This is a free open-access R reference manual for applied epidemiologists and public health practitioners.**</span>

**This book strives to:**  

* Serve as a quick reference manual - not as a textbook or comprehensive R training  
* Address common epidemiological problems via task-centered examples  
* Be accessible in settings with low internet-connectivity via an [offline version](https://github.com/nsbatra/Epi_R_handbook/tree/master/offline_long) (instructions below)  

**What challenges does this book try to address?**  

* Many epidemiologists are transitioning to R from SAS, STATA, SPSS, Excel, or other software  
* Epidemiologists should not need to spend hours searching online for code relevant to the common epi user  
* Epidemiologists sometimes work in low internet-connectivity environments and have limited support  

**How is this different than other R books?**  

* It is written by epidemiologists, for epidemiologists - leveraging experience in local, national, academic, and emergency settings  
* It provides examples of epidemic curves, transmission chains, epidemic modeling and projections, age and sex pyramids and standardization, record matching, outbreak detection, survey analysis, causal diagrams, survival analysis, GIS basics, phylogenetic trees, automated reports, etc...

# Standardization { }  


This page will show you two ways to standardize an outcome, such as hospitalizations or mortality, by characteristics such as age and sex. 

* Using **dsr** package 
* Using **PHEindicatormethods** package  

We begin by extensively demonstrating the processes of data preparation/cleaning/joining, as this is common when combining population data from multiple countries, standard population data, deaths, etc.  

<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Overview {  }

There are two main ways to standardize: direct and indirect standardization.
Let's say we would like to standardize mortality by age and sex for country A and country B, and compare the standardized rates between these countries.

* For direct standardization, you will have to know the number of the at-risk population and the number of deaths for each stratum of age and sex, for country A and country B. One stratum in our example could be females between ages 15-44.  
* For indirect standardization, you only need to know the total number of deaths and the age- and sex structure of each country. This option is therefore feasible if age- and sex-specific mortality rates or population numbers are not available. Indirect standardization is furthermore preferable in case of small numbers per stratum, as estimates in direct standardization would be influenced by substantial sampling variation. 

<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Preparation {  }


To show how standardization is done, we will use fictitious population counts and death counts from  country A and country B, by age (in 5 year categories) and sex (female, male). To make the datasets ready for use, we will perform the following preparation steps:  

1. Load packages  
2. Load datasets  
3. Join the populaton and death data from the two countries
4. Pivot longer so there is one row per age-sex stratum
5. Clean the reference population (world standard population) and join it to the country data  

In your scenario, your data may come in a different format. Perhaps your data are by province, city, or other catchment area. You may have one row for each death and information on age and sex for each (or a significant proportion) of these deaths. In this case, see the pages on [Grouping data] and [Pivoting data] to create a dataset with event and population counts per age-sex stratum.  

We also need a reference population, the standard population. There are several standard populations available, for the purpose of this exercise we will use the `world_standard_population_by_sex`. The World standard population is based on the populations of 46 countries and was developed in 1960. There are many "standard" populations - as one example, the website of [NHS Scotland](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/standard-populations) is quite informative on the European Standard Population, World Standard Population and Scotland Standard Population. 

<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Load packages {-}

This code chunk shows the loading of packages required for the analyses. In this handbook we emphasize `p_load()` from **pacman**, which installs the package if necessary and loads it for use. You can also load packages with `library()` from **base** R. See the page on [R basics] for more information on R packages.  


```{r}
pacman::p_load(
     rio,         # to import data
     here,        # to locate files
     tidyverse,   # to clean, handle, and plot the data (includes ggplot2 package)
     stringr,     # cleaning characters and strings
     frailtypack, # needed for dsr, for frailty models
     dsr,  
     PHEindicatormethods)
```


<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** If you have a newer version of R, the **dsr** package cannot be directly downloaded from CRAN. However, it is still available from the CRAN archive. You can install and use this one. </span>

For non-Mac users:  

```{r, eval=F} 
require(Rtools)
packageurl <- "https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/dsr/dsr_0.2.2.tar.gz"
install.packages(packageurl, repos=NULL, type="source")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Other solution that may work
require(devtools)
devtools::install_version("dsr", version="0.2.2", repos="http:/cran.us.r.project.org")
```

For Mac users:  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
require(devtools)
devtools::install_version("dsr", version="0.2.2", repos="https://mac.R-project.org")
```




### Load population data {-}  

First we load the demographic data (counts of males and females by 5-year age category) for the two countries that we will be comparing, "Country A" and "Country B".  

```{r, echo=F}
# Country A
countryA_demo <- rio::import(here::here("data", "country_demographics.csv")) %>% 
     mutate(Country = "A") %>% 
     select(Country, everything()) %>% # re-arrange
     mutate(age_cat5 = str_replace_all(age_cat5, "\\+", "")) # remove + symbols
```

```{r, eval=F}
# Country A
countryA_demo <- import("country_demographics.csv")
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
DT::datatable(countryA_demo, rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```
```{r, echo=F}
# Country B
countryB_demo <- rio::import(here::here("data", "country_demographics_2.csv")) %>% 
     mutate(Country = "B") %>% 
     select(Country, everything()) # re-arrange
```

```{r, eval=F}
# Country B
countryB_demo <- import("country_demographics_2.csv")
```


```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
DT::datatable(countryB_demo, rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

Besides the `summary()` function, we can also use the `str()` function that gives more details on the structure of the `survfit()` object. Among those details is an important one: *cumhaz* which allows for instance to plot the **_cumulative hazard_**, with the **_hazard_** being the **_instantaneous rate of event occurrence_** (see references).





### Load death counts {-}  

Conveniently, we also have the counts of deaths during the time period of interest, by age and sex. Each country's counts are in a separate file, shown below.   

```{r, echo=F}
A_males <- c(224, 257, 251, 245, 334, 245, 154, 189, 334, 342, 565, 432, 543, 432, 245, 543, 234, 354) # for males of country A
B_males <- c(34, 37, 51, 145, 434, 120, 100, 143, 307, 354, 463, 639, 706, 232, 275, 543, 234, 274) # for males of country B
A_females <- c(194, 254, 232, 214, 316, 224, 163, 167, 354, 354, 463, 574, 493, 295, 175, 380, 177, 392) # for females of country A
B_females <- c(54, 24, 32, 154, 276, 254, 123, 164, 254, 354, 453, 654, 435, 354, 165, 432, 287, 395) # for females of country B

age_cat5 <- c("0-4", "5-9", "10-14", "15-19", "20-24", "25-29",  "30-34", "35-39", "40-44",
                                                                                "45-49", "50-54", "55-59",
                                                                                "60-64", "65-69", "70-74",
                                                                                "75-79", "80-84", "85")
A_deaths <- data.frame(Country = "A", AgeCat = age_cat5, Male = A_males, Female = A_females)
B_deaths <- data.frame(Country = "B", AgeCat = age_cat5, Male = B_males, Female = B_females)
```

Deaths in Country A
```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
DT::datatable(A_deaths, rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

Deaths in Country B

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
DT::datatable(B_deaths, rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```







### Clean populations and deaths {-}  


We need to join and transform these data in the following ways:  

* Combine country populations into one dataset and pivot "long" so that each age-sex stratum is one row  
* Combine country death counts into one dataset and pivot "long" so each age-sex stratum is one row  
* Join the deaths to the populations  

First, we combine the country populations datasets, pivot longer, and do minor cleaning. See the page on [Pivoting data] for more detail.  

```{r}
pop_countries <- countryA_demo %>%  # begin with country A dataset
     bind_rows(countryB_demo) %>%        # bind rows, because cols are identically named
     pivot_longer(                       # pivot longer
          cols = c(m, f),                   # column to transform into one
          names_to = "Sex",                 # name for new column containing the category ("m" or "f") 
          values_to = "Population") %>%     # name for new column containing the numeric values pivoted
     mutate(Sex = recode(                # recode values for clarity
          Sex,
          "m" = "Male",
          "f" = "Female"))
```

The population data now look like this:  

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
DT::datatable(pop_countries, rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

And now we perform similar operations on the two deaths datasets.

```{r}
deaths_countries <- A_deaths %>%    # begin with country A deaths dataset
     bind_rows(B_deaths) %>%        # bind rows with B dataset, because cols are identically named
     pivot_longer(                  # pivot longer
          cols = c(Male, Female),        # column to transform into one
          names_to = "Sex",              # name for new column containing the category ("m" or "f") 
          values_to = "Deaths") %>%      # name for new column containing the numeric values pivoted
     rename(age_cat5 = AgeCat)    # rename for clarity
```

The deaths data now look like this, and contains data from both countries: 

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
DT::datatable(deaths_countries, rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```


We now join the deaths and population data based on common columns `age_cat5`, `Sex`, and `Country`.  

```{r}
country_data <- pop_countries %>% 
     left_join(deaths_countries, by = c("Country", "Sex", "age_cat5"))
```

We can now classify `Sex`, `age_cat5`, and `Country` as factors so their ordering is specified correctly. We use the `as_factor()` function from the **forcats** package, as described in the page on [Factors]. Note, classifying the factor levels doesn't visibly change the data, but the `arrange()` command does sort it by Country, age category, and sex.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
country_data <- country_data %>% 
     mutate(
          Country = as_factor(Country),
          Country = fct_relevel(Country, "A", "B"),
          
          Sex = as_factor(Sex),
          Sex = fct_relevel(Sex, "Male", "Female"),
          
          age_cat5 = as_factor(age_cat5),
          age_cat5 = fct_relevel(age_cat5,
                                 "0-4", "5-9", "10-14", "15-19",
                                 "20-24", "25-29",  "30-34", "35-39",
                                 "40-44", "45-49", "50-54", "55-59",
                                 "60-64", "65-69", "70-74",
                                 "75-79", "80-84", "85")) %>% 
          arrange(Country, age_cat5, Sex)

```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
DT::datatable(country_data, rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** NB. If you have few deaths per stratum, use 10-, or 15-year categories, instead of 5-year categories for age, or combine categories</span>

It was interesting to run the model and look at the results but a first look to verify whether the proportional hazards assumptions is respected could help saving time.

```{r test_assumption}




### Load reference population {-}  


Lastly, we import the reference population (world "standard population" by sex)

```{r, echo=F}
# Reference population
standard_pop_data <- rio::import(here::here("data", "world_standard_population_by_sex.csv")) %>% 
     rename(age_cat5 = AgeGroup)
```

```{r, eval=F}
# Reference population
standard_pop_data <- import("world_standard_population_by_sex.csv")
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
DT::datatable(standard_pop_data, rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

#fit the model
linelistsurv_cox <-  coxph(
                        Surv(futime, event) ~ gender + age_years+ source + days_onset_hosp,
                        data = linelist_surv
                        )



<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Clean reference population {-}

The values of the column `age_cat5` from the `standard_pop_data` contain the word "years" and "plus", while those of the `country_data` do not. We will have to remove this string to make the age category values match. We use `str_replace_all()` from the **stringr** package, as described in the page on [Characters and strings].  

Furthermore, the package **dsr** expects that in the standard population, the column containing counts will be called `"pop"`. So we rename that column accordingly.  

```{r}
# Remove specific string from column values
standard_pop_clean <- standard_pop_data %>%
     mutate(
          age_cat5 = str_replace_all(age_cat5, "years", ""),   # remove "year"
          age_cat5 = str_replace_all(age_cat5, "plus", ""),    # remove "plus"
          age_cat5 = str_replace_all(age_cat5, " ", "")) %>%   # remove " " space
     
     rename(pop = WorldStandardPopulation)   # change col name to "pop", as this is expected by dsr package
```

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** If you try to use `str_replace_all()` to remove a plus *symbol*, it won't work because it is a special symbol. "Escape" the specialnes by putting two back slashes in front, as in `str_replace_call(column, "\\+", "")`. </span>

Finally, the package **PHEindicatormethods**, detailed below, expects the standard populations joined to the country event and population counts. So, we will create a dataset `all_data` for that purpose.  

```{r}
all_data <- left_join(country_data, standard_pop_clean, by=c("age_cat5", "Sex"))
```

This complete dataset looks like this:  

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
DT::datatable(all_data, rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```


<!-- ======================================================= -->

## **dsr** package {  }
 
Below we demonstrate calculating and comparing directly standardized rates using the **dsr** package. The **dsr** package allows you to calculate and compare directly standardized rates (no indirectly standardized rates!).
  
In the data Preparation section, we made separate datasets for country counts and standard population:  

1) the `country_data` object, which is a population table with the number of population and number of deaths per stratum per country  
2) the `standard_pop_clean` object, containing the number of population per stratum for our reference population, the World Standard Population  

We will use these separate datasets for the **dsr** approach.  


<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Standardized rates {-}

Below, we calculate rates per country directly standardized for age and sex. We use the `dsr()` function. 

Of note - `dsr()` expects one data frame for the country populations and event counts (deaths), *and a **separate** data frame with the reference population*. It also expects that in this reference population dataset the unit-time column name is "pop" (we assured this in the data Preparation section).  

There are many arguments, as annotated in the code below. Notably, `event = ` is set to the column `Deaths`, and the `fu = ` ("follow-up") is set to the `Population` column. We set the subgroups of comparison as the column `Country` and we standardize based on `age_cat5` and `Sex`. These last two columns are not assigned a particular named argument. See `?dsr` for details. 

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# Calculate rates per country directly standardized for age and sex
mortality_rate <- dsr::dsr(
     data = country_data,  # specify object containing number of deaths per stratum
     event = Deaths,       # column containing number of deaths per stratum 
     fu = Population,      # column containing number of population per stratum
     subgroup = Country,   # units we would like to compare
     age_cat5,             # other columns - rates will be standardized by these
     Sex,

     sig = 0.95,            # significance level
     mp = 100000,           # we want rates per 100.000 population
     decimals = 2)          # number of decimals)

```

Above, we see that while country A had a lower crude mortality rate than country B, it has a higher standardized rate after direct age and sex standardization.


Analysis of time-dependent covariates in R requires setup of a special dataset. If interested, see the more detailed paper on this by the author of the **survival** package [Using Time Dependent Covariates and Time Dependent Coefficients in the Cox Model](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/vignettes/timedep.pdf).

### Standardized rate ratios {-}

```{r,warning=F, message=F}
# Calculate RR
mortality_rr <- dsr::dsrr(
     data = country_data, # specify object containing number of deaths per stratum
     event = Deaths,      # column containing number of deaths per stratum 
     fu = Population,     # column containing number of population per stratum
     subgroup = Country,  # units we would like to compare
     age_cat5,
     Sex,                 # characteristics to which we would like to standardize 
     refdata = standard_pop_clean, # reference population, with numbers in column called pop
     refgroup = "B",      # reference for comparison
     estimate = "ratio",  # type of estimate
     sig = 0.95,          # significance level
     mp = 100000,         # we want rates per 100.000 population
     decimals = 2)        # number of decimals

# Print table
knitr::kable(mortality_rr) 
```

The standardized mortality rate is 1.22 times higher in country A compared to country B (95% CI 1.17-1.27).

     age_cat5,                  # characteristics to which we would like to standardize
     Sex,                        
     refdata = standard_pop_clean, # reference population, with numbers in column called pop
     refgroup = "B",            # reference for comparison
     estimate = "difference",   # type of estimate

     decimals = 2)              # number of decimals

# Print table
knitr::kable(mortality_rd) 
```

Country A has 4.24 additional deaths per 100.000 population (95% CI 3.24-5.24) compared to country A.

## **PHEindicatormethods** package {  }

Another way of calculating standardized rates is with the **PHEindicatormethods** package. This package allows you to calculate directly as well as indirectly standardized rates. We will show both.

<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Directly standardized rates {-}

Below, we first group the data by Country and then pass it to the function `phe_dsr()` to get directly standardized rates per country.

Of note - the reference (standard) population can be provided as a **column within the country-specific data frame** or as a **separate vector**. If provided within the country-specific data frame, you have to set `stdpoptype = "field"`. If provided as a vector, set `stdpoptype = "vector"`. In the latter case, you have to make sure the ordering of rows by strata is similar in both the country-specific data frame and the reference population, as records will be matched by position. In our example below, we provided the reference population as a column within the country-specific data frame.

See the help with `?phr_dsr` or the links in the References section for more information.  

```{r}
# Calculate rates per country directly standardized for age and sex
mortality_ds_rate_phe <- all_data %>%
     group_by(Country) %>%
     PHEindicatormethods::phe_dsr(
          x = Deaths,                 # column with observed number of events
          n = Population,             # column with non-standard pops for each stratum
          stdpop = pop,               # standard populations for each stratum
          stdpoptype = "field")       # either "vector" for a standalone vector or "field" meaning std populations are in the data  

# Print table
knitr::kable(mortality_ds_rate_phe)
```

<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Indirectly standardized rates {-}

For indirect standardization, you need a reference population with the number of deaths and number of population per stratum. In this example, we will be calculating rates for country A using country B as the reference population, as our previous `standard_pop_clean` reference population does not include number of deaths per stratum. 

Below, we first create the reference population from country B. Then, we pass mortality and population data for country A, combine it with the reference population, and pass it to the function `phe_isr()`, to get indirectly standardized rates. Of course, you can do it also vice versa.

Of note - in our example below, the reference population is provided as a separate data frame. In this case, we make sure that `x = `, `n = `, `x_ref = ` and `n_ref = ` vectors are all ordered by the same standardization category (stratum) values as that in our country-specific data frame, as records will be matched by position.

See the help with `?phr_isr` or the links in the References section for more information.  

```{r}
# Create reference population
refpopCountryB <- country_data %>% 
  filter(Country=="B") 

# Calculate rates for country A indirectly standardized by age and sex
mortality_is_rate_phe_A <- country_data %>%
     filter(Country=="A") %>%
     PHEindicatormethods::phe_isr(
          x = Deaths,                 # column with observed number of events
          n = Population,             # column with non-standard pops for each stratum
          x_ref = refpopCountryB$Deaths,  # reference number of deaths for each stratum
          n_ref = refpopCountryB$Population)  # reference population for each stratum

# Print table
knitr::kable(mortality_is_rate_phe_A)
```
