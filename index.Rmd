<!-- ## About this handbook   -->

## R for applied 'epi' and public health {-}  

**This handbook strives to:**  

* Serve as a quick R code reference manual  
* Provide task-centered examples for addressing common epidemiologic problems  
* Assist epidemiologists transitioning to R from SAS, STATA, SPSS, and Excel  
* Be accessible in settings with low internet-connectivity via an **offline version** ([instructions here][Download handbook and data])  

**How is this different than other R books?**  

* It is written by epidemiologists, for epidemiologists - leveraging experience in local, national, academic, and emergency settings  
* It provides examples of epidemic curves, transmission chains, automated reports and dashboards, epidemic modeling and projections, demographic pyramids and standardization, record matching, outbreak detection, survey analysis, causal diagrams, survival analysis, GIS basics, phylogenetic trees,  etc...
