<!-- ## About this handbook   -->

## R for applied 'epi' and public health {-}  

**This handbook strives to:**  

* Serve as a quick R code reference manual  
* Provide task-centered examples for addressing common epidemiologic problems  
* Assist epidemiologists transitioning to R from SAS, STATA, SPSS, and Excel  
* Be accessible in settings with low internet-connectivity via an **offline version** ([instructions here][Download handbook and data])  

**How is this different than other R books?**  

* It is community-driven - *written for epidemiologists by epidemiologists* in their spare time and leveraging experience in local, national, academic, and emergency settings  
* It uses practical epi examples - cleaning case linelists, making transmission chains and epidemic curves, automated reports and dashboards, modeling incidence and making projections, demographic pyramids and rate standardization, record matching, outbreak detection, survey analysis, survival analysis, GIS basics, contact tracing, phylogenetic trees...
