## About this handbook {-}

**This is a free open-access R reference book for applied epidemiologists and public health practitioners.**  

**This book strives to:**  

* Serve as a quick reference guide - not a textbook  
* Address common epidemiological problems via task-centered examples  
* Be accessible in settings with low internet-connectivity ([link to downloadable version](https://github.com/nsbatra/Epi_R_handbook/tree/master/offline_long))  
* Contain clear and simple language, with step-by-step instructions and helpful code annotation  
* Be a living document, growing and adapting to new best practices  

**What gaps does this book address?**  

* Many epidemiologists lack formal R training or are transitioning from SAS, STATA, or other statistical software.  
* The R universe changes frequently - there should be a place for best practice code catered toward the common epidemiologist user.  
* Epidemiologists often search dozens of online forums for answers, most of which are not epidemiology-oriented.  
* Some epidemiologists work in low internet-connectivity environments and have limited technical support.  

**How is this different than other R books?**  

* This handbook is written by epidemiologists, for epidemiologists. It is **not** an approved product of any specific organization. Examples and techniques are adapted from the authors lived experience in local, national, academic, and emergency settings.  
* The book is offered in a download-able format for settings with unreliable internet.  
* In addition to core R skills this book uses epidemiology-centered examples to cover tasks like *epidemic curves, transmission chains and epidemic modeling, age and sex pyramids, age and sex standardization, probabilistic matching of records, outbreak detection methods, survey analysis, causal diagrams, survival analysis, GIS basics, phylogenetic trees, missing data imputation, automated routine reports with Rmarkdown*, etc...
