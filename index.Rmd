<!-- ======================================================= -->
## About this handbook

This is a free open-source R reference guide catered to field and applied epidemiologists. 

This book strives to:  

* Serve as a quick reference guide - not a textbook  
* Address common epidemiological problems via task-centered examples  
* Be accessible in settings with limited technical support and low internet-connectivity (see THIS downloadable version)  
* Contain clear and simple language, with step-by-step instructions and many comments  
* A living document, growing and adapting to new best practices  

*Epis using R must often Google search and read dozens of forum pages to complete common data manipulation and visualization tasks. Most online tutorials are often not epidemiology-oriented or do not address challenges faced by field epidemiologists. Furthermore, field epidemiologists often work in low internet-connectivity environments and have limited technical support. This handbook aims to fill this gap.*
