<!-- ======================================================= -->
## About this handbook {-}

This is a free open-source R reference guide intended for applied epidemiologists.  

This book strives to:  

* Serve as a quick reference guide - not a textbook  
* Address common epidemiological problems via task-centered examples  
* Be accessible in settings with limited technical support and low internet-connectivity (downloadable version)  
* Contain clear and simple language, with step-by-step instructions and many comments  
* Be a living document, growing and adapting to new best practices  

**What gaps does this book address?**  

* Many epidemiologists do not have formal training in R or data science, or are transitioning to R from SAS, STATA, or other statistical software.  
* The R universe changes frequently - there should be a place for best practice code catered toward the common epidemiologist user.  
* Epidemiologists often must read dozens of online forum pages for answers, most of which are not epidemiology-oriented.  
* Some epidemiologists work in low internet-connectivity environments and have limited technical support.  

**How is this different than other R books?**  

This handbook is written by epidemiologists, for epidemiologists. Examples are taken from lived experience in local, national, academic, and emergency settings. Finally, it is also offered in a download-able format for to bring into settings with unreliable internet.  
In addition to core R concepts and tools, this book covers:  

* epidemic curves  
* transmission chains and performing epidemic modeling
* age pyramids
* age and sex standardization  
* outbreak detection methods  
* survey analysis  
* causal diagrams  
* survival analysis  
* GIS basics
* phylogenetic trees  
* routinized reports with Rmarkdown
