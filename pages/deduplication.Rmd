## Overview {.tabset }

This page covers the following subjects:  

1. Identifying and removing duplicate rows  
2. "Slicing" and keeping only certain rows (min, max, random...), also from each group  
3. "Rolling-up", or combining values from multiple rows into one  


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Preparation {.tabset }


**Load packages**  

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse,   # deduplication, grouping, and slicing functions
               janitor,     # function for reviewing duplicates
               stringr      # for string searches, can be used in "rolling-up" values
               )     
```


**Example dataset**  

For demonstration, we will use the fake dataset below. It is a record of COVID-19 phone encounters, including with contacts and with cases.  

* The first two records are 100% complete duplicates including duplicate `recordID` (computer glitch)  
* The second two rows are duplicates, in all columns *except for `recordID`*  
* Several people had multiple phone encounters, at various dates/times and as contacts or cases  
* At each encounter, the person was asked if they had **ever** had symptoms, and some of this information is missing.  


```{r, echo=F}
obs <- data.frame(
  recordID  = c(1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18),
  personID  = c(1,1,2,2,3,2,4,5,6,7,2,1,3,3,4,5,5,7,8),
  name      = c("adam", "adam", "amrish", "amrish", "mariah", "amrish", "nikhil", "brian", "smita", "raquel", "amrish",
                "adam", "mariah", "mariah", "nikhil", "brian", "brian", "raquel", "natalie"),

## Deduplication {.tabset }


This tab uses the dataset from the Preparation tab to describe how to review and remove duplicate rows in a dataframe. It also show how to handle duplicate elements in a vector.  


<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Examine duplicate rows  


To quickly review rows that have duplicates, you can use `get_dupes()` from the **janitor** package. *By default*, all columns are considered when duplicates are evaluated - rows returned are 100% duplicates considering the values in *all* columns.  

In the `obs` dataframe, the first two rows that are *100% duplicates* - they have the same value in every column (including the `recordID` column, which is *supposed* to be unique - it must be some computer glitch). The returned dataframe automatically includes a new column `dupe_count`, showing the number of rows with that combination of duplicate values. 

```{r, eval=F}
# 100% duplicates across all columns
obs %>% 
  janitor::get_dupes()
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
obs %>% 
  janitor::get_dupes() %>% 
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = nrow(obs), scrollX=T) )
```

However, if we choose to ignore `recordID`, the 3rd and 4th rows rows are also duplicates. That is, they have the same values in all columns *except* for `recordID`. You can specify specific columns to be ignored in the function using a `-` minus symbol.  

```{r, eval=F}
# Duplicates when column recordID is not considered
obs %>% 
  janitor::get_dupes(-recordID)         # if multiple columns, wrap them in c()
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
obs %>% 
  janitor::get_dupes(-recordID) %>% 
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = nrow(obs), scrollX=T) )
```

You can also positively specify the columns to consider. Below, only rows that have the same values in the `name` and `purpose` columns are returned. Notice how "amrish" now has `dupe_count` equal to 3 to reflect his three "contact" encounters.  

*Scroll left for more rows**  

```{r, eval=F}
# duplicates based on name and purpose columns ONLY
obs %>% 
  janitor::get_dupes(name, purpose)
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
obs %>% 
  janitor::get_dupes(name, purpose) %>% 
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 7, scrollX=T) )
```

See `?get_dupes` for more details, or see this [online reference](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/janitor.html#explore-records-with-duplicated-values-for-specific-combinations-of-variables-with-get_dupes)  






<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Keep only unique rows  


To keep only unique rows of a dataframe, use `distinct()` from **dplyr**. Rows that are duplicates are removed such that only the first of such rows is kept. By default, "first" means the highest `rownumber` (order of rows top-to-bottom). Only unique rows are kept. In the example below, **one duplicate row (the first row, for "adam") has been removed** (n is now `r nrow(obs)-1`, not `r nrow(obs)` rows).  

*Scroll to the left to see the entire dataframe*  


```{r, eval=F}
# added to a chain of pipes (e.g. data cleaning)
obs %>% 
  distinct(across(-recordID), # reduces dataframe to only unique rows (keeps first one of any duplicates)
           .keep_all = TRUE) 

# if outside pipes, include the data as first argument 
# distinct(obs)
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
obs %>% 
  distinct(across(-recordID), # reduces dataframe to only unique rows (keeps first one of any duplicates)
           .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 6, scrollX=T) )
```

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** If using `distinct()` on grouped data, the function will apply to each group.</span>


**Deduplicate based on specific columns**  

You can also specify columns to be the basis for de-duplication. In this way, the de-duplication only applies to rows that are duplicates within the specified columns. Unless specified with `.keep_all = TRUE`, all columns not mentioned will be dropped.  

In the example below, the de-duplication only applies to rows that have identical values for `name` and `purpose` columns. Thus, "brian" has only 2 rows instead of 3 - his *first* "contact" encounter and his only "case" encounter. To adjust so that brian's *latest* encounter of each purpose is kept, see the tab on Slicing within groups.  

*Scroll to the left to see the entire dataframe*  

```{r, eval=F}
# added to a chain of pipes (e.g. data cleaning)
obs %>% 
  distinct(name, purpose, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%  # keep rows unique by name and purpose, retain all columns
  arrange(name)                                  # arrange for easier viewing
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
obs %>% 
  distinct(name, purpose, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%  # keep rows unique by name and purpose, retain all columns
  arrange(name) %>% 
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 6, scrollX=T) )
```
<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Duplicate elements in a vector  


The function `duplicated()` from **base** R will evaluate a vector (column) and return a logical vector of the same length (TRUE/FALSE). The first time a value appears, it will return FALSE (not a duplicate), and subsequent times that value appears it will return TRUE. Note how `NA` is treated the same as any other value.    

```{r}
x <- c(1, 1, 2, NA, NA, 4, 5, 4, 4, 1, 2)
duplicated(x)
```

To return only the duplicated elements, you can use brackets to subset the original vector: 

```{r}
x[duplicated(x)]
```

To return only the unique elements, use `unique()` from **base** R. To remove `NA`s from the output, nest `na.omit()` within `unique()`.  

```{r}
unique(x)           # alternatively, use x[!duplicated(x)]
unique(na.omit(x))  # remove NAs 
```


<!-- ======================================================= -->
### with **base** R 

**To return duplicate rows**  

In **base** R, you can also see which rows are 100% duplicates in a dataframe `df` with the command `duplicated(df)` (returns a logical vector of the rows).  

Thus, you can also use the base subset `[ ]` on the dataframe to see the *duplicated* rows with `df[duplicated(df),]` (don't forget the comma, meaning that you want to see all columns!). 

**To return unique rows**  

See the notes above. To see the *unique* rows you add the logical negator `!` in front of the `duplicated()` function:  
`df[!duplicated(df),]`  


**To return rows that are duplicates of only certain columns**  

Subset the `df` that is *within the `duplicated()` parentheses*, so this function will operate on only certain columns of the `df`.  

To specify the columns, provide column numbers or names after a comma (remember, all this is *within* the `duplicated()` function).  

Be sure to keep the comma `,` *outside* after the `duplicated()` function as well! 

For example, to evaluate only columns 2 through 5 for duplicates:  `df[!duplicated(df[, 2:5]),]`  
To evaluate only columns `name` and `purpose` for duplicates: `df[!duplicated(df[, c("name", "purpose)]),]`  





<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Slicing {.tabset }


To "slice" a dataframe is useful in de-duplication if you have multiple rows per functional group (e.g. per "person") and you only want to analyze one or some of them. Think of slicing a filter on the rows, by row number/position. 

**The basic `slice()` function** accepts a number `n`. If positive, only the *nth* row is returned. If negative, all rows *except the nth* are returned.   

**Variations** include:    

* `slice_min()` and `slice_max()`  - to keep only the row with the minimium or maximum value of the specified column. Also worked with ordered factors.    
* `slice_head()` and `slice_tail` - to keep only the *first* or *last* row  
* `slice_sample()`  - to keep only a random sample of the rows  

Use arguments `n = ` or `prop = ` to specify the number or proportion of rows to keep. If not using the function in a pipe chain, provide the data argument first (e.g. `slice(df, n = 2)`). See `?slice` for more information.  

Other arguments:  

`.order_by = ` - used in `slice_min()` and `slice_max()` this is a column to order by before slicing.  
`with_ties = ` - TRUE by default, meaning ties are kept.  
`.preserve = ` - FALSE by default. If TRUE then the grouping structure is re-calculated after slicing.  
`weight_by = ` - Optional, numeric column to weight by (bigger number more likely to get sampled).  Also `replace = ` for whether sampling is done with/without replacement.  

<span style="color: darkgreen;">**_TIP:_** When using `slice_max()` and `slice_min()`, be sure to specify/write the `n = `  (e.g. `n = 2`, not just `2`). Otherwise you may get an error `Error: `...` is not empty.` </span>

<span style="color: black;">**_NOTE:_** You may encounter the function [`top_n()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/top_n.html), which has been superseded by the `slice` functions.</span>

Here, the basic `slice()` function is used to keep only the 4th row:  

```{r, eval=F}
obs %>% 
  slice(4)  # keeps the 4th row only
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
obs %>% 
  slice(4) %>%   # keeps the 4th row only
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 1, scrollX=T) )
```


<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Slice with groups  

The `slice_*()` functions can be very useful if applied to a grouped dataframe, as the slice operation is performed on each group separately. Use the **function** `group_by()` in conjunction with `slice()` to group the data and then take a slice from each group.   
This is helpful for de-duplication if you have multiple rows per person but only want to keep one of them. You first use `group_by()` with key columns that are the same, and then use a slice function on a column that will differ among the grouped rows.  

In the example below, to keep only the *latest* encounter *per person*, we group the rows by `name` and then use `slice_max()` with `n = 1` on the `date` column. Be aware! To apply a function like `slice_max()` on dates, the date column must be class Date.   

By default, "ties" (e.g. same date in this scenario) are kept, and we would still get multiple rows for some people (e.g. adam). To avoid this we set `with_ties = FALSE`. We get back only one row per person.  

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** If using `arrange()`, specify `.by_group = TRUE` to have the data arranged within each group.</span>

<span style="color: red;">**_DANGER:_** If `with_ties = FALSE`, the first row of a tie is kept. This may be deceptive. See how for Mariah, she has two encounters on her latest date (6 Jan) and the first (earliest) one was kept. Likely, we want to keep her later encounter on that day. See how to "break" these ties in the next example. </span>  




```{r, eval=F}
obs %>% 
  group_by(name) %>%       # group the rows by 'name'
  slice_max(date,          # keep row per group with maximum date value 
            n = 1,         # keep only the single highest row 
            with_ties = F) # if there's a tie (of date), take the first row
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
obs %>% 
  group_by(name) %>%       # group the rows by 'name'
  slice_max(date,          # keep row per group with maximum date value 
            n = 1,         # keep only the single highest row 
            with_ties = F) %>%  # if there's a tie (of date), take the first row
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 8, scrollX=T) )
```

**Breaking "ties"**  

Multiple slice statements can be run to "break ties". In this case, if a person has multiple encounters on their latest *date*, the encounter with the latest *time* is kept (`lubridate::hm()` is used to convert the character times to a sortable time class).  
Note how now, the one row kept for "Mariah" on 6 Jan is encounter 3 from 08:32, not encounter 2 at 07:25.  

```{r, eval=F}
# Example of multiple slice statements to "break ties"
obs %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  
  # FIRST - slice by latest date
  slice_max(date, n = 1, with_ties = TRUE) %>% 
  
  # SECOND - if there is a tie, select row with latest time; ties prohibited
  slice_max(lubridate::hm(time), n = 1, with_ties = FALSE)
```
```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
# Example of multiple slice statements to "break ties"
obs %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  
  # FIRST - slice by latest date
  slice_max(date, n = 1, with_ties = TRUE) %>% 
  
  # SECOND - if there is a tie, select row with latest time; ties prohibited
  slice_max(lubridate::hm(time), n = 1, with_ties = FALSE) %>% 
  
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 8, scrollX=T) )
```

*In the example above, it would also have been possible to slice by `encounter` number, but we showed the slice on `date` and `time` for example purposes.*  

<span style="color: darkgreen;">**_TIP:_** To use `slice_max()` or `slice_min()` on a "character" column, mutate it to an *ordered* factor class!</span>



<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Keep all but mark them  

If you want to keep all records but mark only some for analysis, consider a two-step approach utilizing a unique recordID/encounter number:  

1) Reduce/slice the orginal dataframe to only the rows for analysis. Save/retain this reduced dataframe.  
2) In the original dataframe, mark rows as appropriate with `case_when()`, based on whether their record unique identifier (recordID in this example) is present in the reduced dataframe.  


```{r, eval=F}
# 1. Define dataframe of rows to keep for analysis
obs_keep <- obs %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  slice_max(encounter, n = 1, with_ties = FALSE) # keep only latest encounter per person


# 2. Mark original dataframe
obs_marked <- obs %>%

  # make new dup_record column
  mutate(dup_record = case_when(
    
    # if record is in obs_keep dataframe
    recordID %in% obs_keep$recordID ~ "For analysis", 
    
    # all else marked as "Ignore" for analysis purposes
    TRUE                            ~ "Ignore"))

# print
obs_marked
```

<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Calculate row completeness  

Create a column that contains a metric for the row's completeness (non-missingness). This could be helpful when deciding which rows to prioritize over others when de-duplicating/slicing.  

In this example, "key" columns over which you want to measure completeness are saved in a vector of column names.  

Then the new column `key_completeness` is created with `mutate()`. The new value in each row is defined as a calculated fraction: the number of non-missing values in that row among the key columns, divided by the number of key columns.  

This involves the function `rowSums()` from **base** R. Also used is `.`, which within piping refers to the dataframe at that point in the pipe (in this case, it is being subset with brackets `[]`).  

*Scroll to the right to see more rows**  

```{r, eval=F}
# create a "key variable completeness" column
# this is a *proportion* of the columns designated as "key_vars" that have non-missing values

key_cols = c("personID", "name", "symptoms_ever")

obs %>% 
  mutate(key_completeness = rowSums(!is.na(.[,key_cols]))/length(key_cols)) 
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
key_cols = c("personID", "name", "symptoms_ever")

obs %>% 
  mutate(key_completeness = rowSums(!is.na(.[,key_cols]))/length(key_cols)) %>% 
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T) )
```





<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Roll-up values {.tabset }


This tab describes:  

1) How to "roll-up" values from multiple rows into just one row, with some variations  
2) Once you have "rolled-up" values, how to overwrite/prioritize the values in each cell  

This tab uses the example dataset from the Preparation tab.  



<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Roll-up values into one row  

The code example below uses `group_by()` and `summarise()` to group rows by person, and then paste together all unique values within the grouped rows. Thus, you get one summary row per person. A few notes:  

* A suffix is appended to all new columns ("_roll" in this example)  
* If you want to show only unique values per cell, then wrap the `na.omit()` with `unique()`  
* `na.omit()` removes `NA` values, but if this is not desired it can be removed `paste0(.x)`...  

*Scroll to the left to see more rows*  

```{r, eval=F}
# "Roll-up" values into one row per group (per "personID") 
cases_rolled <- obs %>% 
  
  # create groups by name
  group_by(personID) %>% 
  
  # order the rows within each group (e.g. by date)
  arrange(date, .by_group = TRUE) %>% 
  
  # For each column, paste together all values within the grouped rows, separated by ";"
  summarise(
    across(everything(),                           # apply to all columns
           ~paste0(na.omit(.x), collapse = "; "))) # function is defined which combines non-NA values
```

The result is one row per group (`ID`), with entries arranged by date and pasted together.  

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
# "Roll-up" values into one row per group (per "personID") 
obs %>% 
  
  # create groups by name
  group_by(personID) %>% 
  
  # order the rows within each group (e.g. by date)
  arrange(date, .by_group = TRUE) %>% 
  
  # For each column, paste together all values within the grouped rows, separated by ";"
  summarise(
    across(everything(),                                # apply to all columns
           ~paste0(na.omit(.x), collapse = "; "))) %>%  # function is defined which combines non-NA values

  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T))
```

**This variation shows unique values only:**  

```{r}
# Variation - show unique values only 
cases_rolled <- obs %>% 
  group_by(personID) %>% 
  arrange(date, .by_group = TRUE) %>% 
  summarise(
    across(everything(),                                   # apply to all columns
           ~paste0(unique(na.omit(.x)), collapse = "; "))) # function is defined which combines unique non-NA values
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
# Variation - show unique values only 
obs %>% 
  group_by(personID) %>% 
  arrange(date, .by_group = TRUE) %>% 
  summarise(
    across(everything(),                                   # apply to all columns
           ~paste0(unique(na.omit(.x)), collapse = "; "))) %>%  # function is defined which combines unique non-NA values

  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T) )
```


**This variation appends a suffix to each column.**  
In this case "_roll" to signify that it has been rolled:  

```{r, eval=F}
# Variation - suffix added to column names 
cases_rolled <- obs %>% 
  group_by(personID) %>% 
  arrange(date, .by_group = TRUE) %>% 
  summarise(
    across(everything(),                
           list(roll = ~paste0(na.omit(.x), collapse = "; ")))) # _roll is appended to column names
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
# Variation - suffix added to column names 
obs %>% 
  group_by(personID) %>% 
  arrange(date, .by_group = TRUE) %>% 
  summarise(
    across(everything(),                
           list(roll = ~paste0(na.omit(.x), collapse = "; ")))) %>%  # _roll is appended to column names
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T) )
```


<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Overwrite values/hierarchy  


If you then want to evaluate all of the rolled values, and keep only a specific value (e.g. "best" or "maximum" value), you can use `mutate()` across the desired columns, to implement `case_when()`, which uses `str_detect()` from the **stringr** package to sequentially look for string patterns and overwrite the cell content.  

```{r}
# CLEAN CASES
#############
cases_clean <- cases_rolled %>% 
    
    # clean Yes-No-Unknown vars: replace text with "highest" value present in the string
    mutate(across(c(contains("symptoms_ever")),                     # operates on specified columns (Y/N/U)
             list(mod = ~case_when(                                 # adds suffix "_mod" to new cols; implements case_when()
               
               str_detect(.x, "Yes")       ~ "Yes",                 # if "Yes" is detected, then cell value converts to yes
               str_detect(.x, "No")        ~ "No",                  # then, if "No" is detected, then cell value converts to no
               str_detect(.x, "Unknown")   ~ "Unknown",             # then, if "Unknown" is detected, then cell value converts to Unknown
               TRUE                        ~ as.character(.x)))),   # then, if anything else if it kept as is
      .keep = "unused")                                             # old columns removed, leaving only _mod columns
```


Now you can see in the column `symptoms_ever` that if the person EVER said "Yes" to symptoms, then only "Yes" is displayed.  

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(cases_clean, rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 10, scrollX=T))
```
