The data are imported using import() from the rio package. See the page on importing data for various ways to import data. The import() function wraps around the here() function of the here package, which serves to locate the file in its folder. Each data set is displayed below as a table for viewing. For most of this document, the linelist dataset will be used. The aggregated counts dataset will be used at the end. # import the linelist into R linelist &lt;- rio::import(here::here(&quot;epicurve&quot;, &quot;data&quot;, &quot;fluH7N9_china_2013.csv&quot;)) # import the counts data into R count_data &lt;- rio::import(here::here(&quot;epicurve&quot;, &quot;data&quot;, &quot;Disease_reports_aggregated.xlsx&quot;)) "]
