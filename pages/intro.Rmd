## About this handbook
<h2> About this handbook </h2>

**Objective**  

**To make an open-access digital R reference book which is catered to epidemiologists and public health practitioners, usable offline, and addresses common epidemiological tasks via clear text explanations, step-by-step instructions, and best practice R code examples**


**The problem:**

Most online R help resources are not task-centered nor epidemiology-focused. Epis learning or new to R often must Google and skim dozens of forum pages to complete common data manipulation and visualization epi tasks. Furthermore, field epidemiologists often work in low internet-connectivity environments and have limited technical support.  


  
**How to read this handbook:**  

* *This handbook in an HTML file. It is not online, you are only using your web browser to view this local file.*  

* *This handbook is ***best viewed with Google Chrome***. Some functions may not work in other browsers.*  

* *Use tabs on the right to hide/view code. See 'Copy to clipboard' icon in the upper-right of each code section*  


**Version**  
The latest version of this handbook can be found at this [github repository](https://github.com/nsbatra/R_epi_handbook).  


**Style**

* The handbook gives one recommended way of completing a task, and offers other methods/packages as appropriate.  
* The handbook generally uses **tidyverse** R codying style. Read more here (TODO).
* Package names are written in bold (e.g. **dplyr**) and functions are like this: `mutate()`.  
* Code in this handbook sometimes explicity names the package of a function (e.g. `dplyr::mutate()`), so it is clear to the reader which package is being used.  


**Types of notes**

```
FOR EXAMPLE: This is a boxed example

```

<span style="color: black;">**_NOTE:_** This is a note</span>

<span style="color: darkgreen;">**_TIP:_** This is a tip.</span>

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** This is a cautionary note.</span>

<span style="color: red;">**_DANGER:_** This is a warning.</span>
