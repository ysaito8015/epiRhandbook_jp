# Survival analysis {.tabset .tabset-fade}  


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Overview {#survanal .tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}


*Survival analysis* focuses on describing for a given individual or group of individuals, a defined point of event called **_the failure_** (occurrence of a disease, cure from a disease, death, relapse after response to treatment...) that occurs after a period of time called **_failure time_** (or  **_follow-up time_** in cohort/population-based studies) during which individuals are observed. To determine the failure time, it is then necessary to define a time of origin (that can be the inclusion date, the date of diagnosis...). 

The target of inference for survival analysis is then the time between an origin and an event.
In current medical research, it is widely used in clinical studies to assess the effect of a treatment for instance, or in cancer epidemiology to assess a large variety of cancer survival measures. 


It is usually expressed through the **_survival probability_** which is the probability that the event of interest has not occurred by a duration t.


**_Censoring_**: Censoring occurs when at the end of follow-up, some of the individuals have not had the event of interest, and thus their true time to event is unknown. We will mostly focus on right censoring here but for more details on censoring and survival analysis in general, you can see references. 


```{r eval=F, out.width = "80%", out.height="80%", fig.align = "center"}
 
#Add a figure from the following chunks for the last version of the page
#do not forget to save the output figure in "images"
# knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "survanalysis.png"))

```  

<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Preparation {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

To run survival analyses in R, one the most widely used package is the **survival** package. We first install it and then load ot as well as the other packages that will be used in this section:

```{r, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#install survival and survminer packages if not installed
if(!require(survival)) install.packages("survival")
if(!require(survminer)) install.packages("survminer")


#load the different packages needed for this page
pacman::p_load(
  rio,        # importing data  
  here,       # relative file pathways  
  tidyverse,   # data manipulation and visualization
  survival,    #survival analysis
  survminer,   #survival analysis: advance KM curves...
  
)


```


This page explores survival analyses using the linelist used in most of the previous pages and on which we apply some changes to have a proper survival data.

We start by loading the linelist as you have done previously using the `rio::import()` function.

* Loading dataset  

```{r import_dataset}

# import linelist using the "here" function

linelist_case_data <- rio::import(here::here("data", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))

```

* Adding or changing variables 

In short survival data can be described as having the following three characteristics:

1) the dependent variable or response is the waiting time until the occurrence of a well-defined event,
2) observations are censored, in the sense that for some units the event of interest has not occurred at the time the data are analyzed, and 
3) there are predictors or explanatory variables whose effect on the waiting time we wish to assess or control. 

Thus, we will create different variables needed to respect that structure and run the survival analysis.

We define:

- our event of interest as being "death" (hence our survival probability will be the probability of being alive after a certain time after the time of origin),
- the follow-up time (`futime`) as the time between the time of onset and the time of outcome *in days*,
- censored patients as those who recovered or for whom the final outcome is not known ie the event "death" was not observed (`event=0`).

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** Since in a real cohort study, the information on the time of origin and the end of the follow-up is known given individuals are observed, we will remove observations where the date of onset or the date of outcome is unknown. Also the cases where the date of onset is later than the date of outcome will be removed since they are considered as wrong.</span>

<span style="color: darkgreen;">**_TIP:_** Given that filtering to greater than (>) or less than (<) a date can remove rows with missing values, applying the filter on the wrong dates will also remove the rows with missing dates.</span>

We then create from the var `age_cat` another variable `age_cat_small` that indicates reduces the categories of the age groups to 3.

```{r create_new_vars}


#create a new data called linelist_surv from the linelist_case_data

linelist_surv <-  linelist_case_data %>% 
  
  
  dplyr::filter(date_outcome > date_onset) %>% #remove observations with wrong or missing dates of onset or date of outcome
  
  dplyr::mutate(
                  event = ifelse(is.na(outcome) | outcome == "Recover", 0, 1), #create the event var which is 1 if the patient died and 0 if he was right censored
    
                   futime = as.double(date_outcome - date_onset), #create the var on the follow-up time in days
    
                   age_cat_small = dplyr::case_when( #create a new age category variable with only 3 strata levels
                     
                      age_years < 5  ~ "0-4",
                      age_years >= 5 & age_years < 20 ~ "5-19",
                      age_years >= 20   ~ "20+"
                      ),
    
                  age_cat_small = factor( #previous step created the var as character, encode it as factor and precise the levels. Note that the NA values remain NA's and are not put in a level "unknown" for example since in the next analyses they have to be removed.
                    
                      age_cat_small, 
                      levels = c("0-4", "5-19", "20+")),

    )


```


<span style="color: darkgreen;">**_TIP:_** We can verify the new variables we have created by doing a summary on the `futime` and a cross-tabulation between `event` and `outcome` from which it was created. Besides this verification it is a good habit communicating on the median follow-up time when interpreting survival analysis results.</span>

```{r verif_newvars}

summary(linelist_surv$futime)

#cross tabulate the new event var and the outcome var from which it was created to make sure the code did what it was intended to
with(linelist_surv, 
     table(outcome, event, useNA = "ifany")
     )


#cross tabulate the new age_cat_small var and the age_cat var from which it was created to make sure the code did what it was intended to

with(linelist_surv, 
     table(age_cat_small, age_cat, useNA = "ifany")
     ) 


#print the 10 first observations of the linelist_surv data looking at specific variables (including those newly created)

head(linelist_surv[,c("case_id", "age_cat_small", "date_onset","date_outcome","outcome","event","futime")], 10)

```




<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Basics of survival analysis {#basicsurv .tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}


### Building a surv-type object

We will first use `Surv()` to build a standard survival object form the follow-up time and the event variables.The result of such a step is to produce an object of type *survival* that focuses on the time information by precising whether or not the event of interest (death) was observed. This is done using a “+” after the time in the print out of *survobj* that indicates right-censoring.

```{r survobj }

survobj <- with(linelist_surv, 
                
                survival::Surv(futime, event)
                
                )

#print the 50 firts elements of the vector to see how it presents
head(survobj,50)


```


### Running initial analyses

We then start our analysis using the `survfit()` function to produce a *survfit object*, which fits the default calculations for **_Kaplan Meier_** (KM) estimates of the overall (marginal) survival curve, which are in fact a step function with jumps at observed event times. The final *survfit object*  contains one or more survival curvesis and is created using the *Surv object* as a response variable in the model formul.

<span style="color: black;">**_NOTE:_** The Kaplan-Meier estimate is a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the survival function. . (see resources for more information).</span>

The summary of this *survfit object* will give what is called a *life table* that contains:
 * for each of the time of the follow-up (`time`) where an event happened and that are ascending ordered, 
 * the number of people who were at risk of developing the event (people who did not have the event yet nor were censored: `n.risk`),
 * those who did develop it  (`n.event`), 
 * and from this, the probability of not developing the event  (probability of not dying or of being alive at that specific time which is basically `1-(n.event/n.risk)` ).
 * Finally the standard error and the confidence interval for that probability are derived.

We can also use the `print()` function. The `print.rmean=TRUE` argument is used to obtain the mean and its standard error (se).


```{r fit}

#fit the KM estimates using the formula where the previously Surv object "survobj" is the response variable. "~ 1" precises we run the model for the overall survival.

linelistsurv_fit <-  survival::survfit(
  survobj ~ 1
  )

#print its summary for more details
summary(linelistsurv_fit)


#print the linelistsurv_fit object and ask for information on the mean follow-up time and its se. 
print(linelistsurv_fit, 
      print.rmean = TRUE
      )


```

<span style="color: darkgreen;">**_TIP:_** We can create the *surv object* directly in the `survfit()` function and save a line of code. This will then give `linelistsurv_quick <-  survfit(Surv(futime, event) ~ 1, data=linelist_surv)`. But as you have seen, in such case we have to precise the data where the variables time and event are taken from.</span>

Besides the `summary()` function, we can also use the `str()` function that gives more details on the structure of the `survfit()` object. Among those details is an important one: *cumhaz* which allows for instance to plot the **_cumulative hazard_**, with the **_hazard_** being the **_instantaneous rate of event occurrence_** (see references).

```{r fit_struct}

print(str(linelistsurv_fit))

```

<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Plotting Kaplan-Meir curves  {#kmcurves .tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

Once the KM estimates are fitted, we can visualize that probability of being alive through the time using the basic `plot()` function that draws the so-known "Kaplan-Meier curve". In other words the curve below is a conventional illustration of the survival experience in the whole patient group.

We can easily verify the follow-up time min and max on the curve. An easy way to interpret it is to say that the proportion of participants surviving past 60 days of f-u is around 40%.

```{r kmcurve}

plot(linelistsurv_fit, 
     xlab = "Days of follow-up",    #xaxis label
     ylab="Survival Probability",   #yaxis label
     main= "Overall survival curve" #figure title
     )

```

The confidence interval of the KM estimates of the survival are also plotted by default and can be dismissed by adding the option `conf.int=FALSE` to the `plot()` command.

Since the event of interest is "death", drawing a curve describing the complements of the survival proportions will lead to drawing the cumulative mortality proportions.


```{r km_curve_cum}

plot(
     linelistsurv_fit,
     xlab = "Days of follow-up",       
     ylab="Survival Probability",       
     mark.time=TRUE,              #mark times of events to facilitate reading of the curve: a "+" sign is printed on the curve at every event
     conf.int=FALSE,             #do not plot the confidence interval
     main= "Overall survival curve and cumulative mortality"
     )



#draw an additional curve to the previous plot
lines( 
      linelistsurv_fit, 
      lty=3,          #use a different line type to differenciate between the two curves and for legend clarity purposes
      fun = "event", #draw the cumulative events instead of the survival 
      mark.time=FALSE, 
      conf.int=FALSE 
      )

#add a legend to the plot
legend("topright", #position of the legend in the plot
       legend=c("Survival","Cum. Mortality"), #legend text 
       lty = c(1,3), #line types to use in the legend, should follow linetype used to draw the two curves
       cex=.85, #factor that defines size of the legend text
       bty = "n" #no box type to be drawn for the legend
       )

```

<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Comparison of  survival curves 

To compare the survival within different groups of our observed participants or patients, we might need to first look at their respective survival curves and then run tests to evaluate the difference between independent groups. This comparison can concern groups based on gender, age, treatment, comorbidity...

### Log rank test {#logrank .tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

The log rank test is a popular test that compares the entire survival experience between two or more *independent* groups and can be thought of as a test of whether the survival curves are identical (overlapping) or not (null hypothesis of no difference in survival between the groups). The `survdiff()` function of the **survival package** allows running the log-rank test when we specify `rho=0` which is the default. The test results gives a chi-square statistic along with a p-value since the log rank statistic is approximately distributed as a chi-square test statistic.

 We first try to compare the survival curves by gender group. For this, we first try to visualize it (check whether the two survival curves are overlapping). A new *survfit object*  will be created with a slightly different formula. Then the *survdiff object* will be created.

```{r comp_surv, warning=FALSE}

#create the new survfit object based on gender
linelistsurv_fit_sex <-  survfit(
              Surv(futime, event) ~ gender, #formula to create the survival curve: surv object 
              data = linelist_surv)


#plot the survival curves by gender
col_sex <- c("lightgreen", "darkgreen")

plot(linelistsurv_fit_sex,
     col=col_sex,
     xlab = "Days of follow-up", 
     ylab="Survival Probability"
     )

legend("topright", 
       legend=c("Female","Male"), 
       col =col_sex,
       lty = 1, cex=.7, bty = "n" 
       )

#compute the test of the difference between the survival curves
survdiff(
          Surv(futime, event) ~ gender, 
          data = linelist_surv
         )

```

Some packages allow illustrating survival curves for different groups and testing the difference at once. Using the `ggsurvplot()` function from the *survminer* package, we can add in our curve the print of the risk tables for each group as well the p-value from the log-rank test. 

We find back the p-value that was found in the previous step.

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** **survminer** functions require since the latest versions, specifying again the data used to fit the survival object. Remember doing this to avoid non-specific error messages. </span>

```{r comp_survminer}

survminer::ggsurvplot(
  
    linelistsurv_fit_sex, 
    data= linelist_surv, #precise again the data used to fit the linelistsurv_fit_sex even though it is already precised in that object
    conf.int = F, #do not show confidence interval of KM estimates
    surv.scale = "percent",  #present probabilities in the y axis in %
    break.time.by=10, #present the time axis with an increment of 10 days
    xlab = "Follow-up days", ylab= "Survival Probability",
    pval=T, pval.coord= c(40,.91),  #print p-value of Log-rank test and at the position with these coordinates
    risk.table=T,  #print the risk table 
    legend.title = "Gender",
    legend.labs = c("Female","Male"), font.legend = 10, #legend characteristics
    palette = "Dark2", #existing palette name precised,
    surv.median.line = "hv", #draw a line to the median survival
    ggtheme = theme_light()
)

```

The log-rank test does not gives enough evidence of a statistically difference between the survival among Women and the survival among Men.

We can then look for a difference in the source of the contamination. In this case, the Log rank test gives enough evidence of a difference in the survival probabilities at `alpha= 0.005`.
The survival probabilities for patients that got infected in funerals are higher than the survival probabilities for patients that got infected in other places, suggesting a survival benefit.

```{r comp_surv_source}

linelistsurv_fit_source <-  survfit(
              Surv(futime, event) ~ source,
              data = linelist_surv
              )

ggsurvplot( 
      linelistsurv_fit_source, data= linelist_surv,
      size=1, linetype = "strata",
      conf.int = T, 
      surv.scale = "percent",  
      break.time.by=10, 
      xlab = "Follow-up days", ylab= "Survival Probability",
      pval=T, pval.coord= c(40,.91),  
      risk.table=T,
      legend.title = "Source of \ninfection", legend.labs = c("Funeral","Other"), 
      font.legend = 10,
      palette = c("#E7B800","#3E606F"),
      surv.median.line = "hv", 
      ggtheme = theme_light()
)

```


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Cox regression analysis {#coxmodel .tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

Cox proportional hazards regression is one of the most popular regression techniques for survival analysis. It is used to assess the effect of several risk factors or exposures simultaneously on the survival time. Other models  can also be used since the Cox model requires *important assumptions* that need to be verified for an appropriate use such as the proportional hazards assumption: see references. 

In a Cox proportional hazards regression model, the measure of effect is the **_hazard rate_** (HR), which is the risk of failure or the risk of death in our example, given that the participant has survived up to a specific time.  Usually, we are interested in comparing groups with respect to their hazards, and we use a hazard ratio, which is analogous to an odds ratio in the setting of multiple logistic regression analysis. The `cox.ph()` from the **survival** package is used to fit the model.
The function `cox.zph()` from **survival** package may be used to test the proportional hazards assumption for a Cox regression model fit. 




<span style="color: black;">**_NOTE:_** A probability must lie in the range 0 to 1. However, the hazard represents the expected number of events per one unit of time. 
* If the hazard ratio for a predictor is close to 1 then that predictor does not affect survival,
* if the HR is less than 1, then the predictor is protective (i.e., associated with improved survival),
* and if the HR is greater than 1, then the predictor is associated with increased risk (or decreased survival).</span> 


We can first fit a model to assess the effect of age and gender on the survival. By just printing the model, we have the information on:

  + the estimated regression coefficients (`coef`) which quantifies the association between the predictors and the outcome,
  + their exponential (for interpretability, `exp(coef)`) which produces the *hazard ratio*,
  + their standard error (`se(coef)`),
  + the z-score: how many standard errors is the estimated coefficient away from  0,
  + and the p-value:  the propability that the estimated coefficient could be 0.
  
  The `summary()` function applied to the cox model object gives more info such as the confidence interval of the estimated HR and the different test scores.

The effect of the first covariate `gender`  is presented in the first row. `genderm` is printed stating that the first strata level ("f") i.e the female group is the reference group for the gender. Thus the interpretation of the test parameter is that of men compared to women. The p-value  indicates there was no enough evidence of an effect of the gender on the time to death.

The same lack f evidence is noted regarding age-group.


```{r coxmodel_agesex}

#fitting the model
linelistsurv_cox_sexage <-  survival::coxph(
              Surv(futime, event) ~ gender + age_cat_small, 
              data = linelist_surv
              )


#printing the model fitted
linelistsurv_cox_sexage


#summary of the model
summary(linelistsurv_cox_sexage)

```


It was interesting to run the model and look at the results but a first look to verify whether the proportional hazards assumptions is respected could help saving time.

```{r, test_assumption}

test_ph_sexage <- survival::cox.zph(linelistsurv_cox_sexage)
test_ph_sexage

```


<span style="color: black;">**_NOTE:_** A second argument called *method* can be specified when computing the cox model. It is the determines how ties are handled. The *default* is "efron", and the other options are "breslow" and "exact".</span>

In another model we add more risk factors such as the source of infection and the number of days between date of onset and admission. This time, we first  verify the proportional hazards assumption before going forward.

In this model, we have included a continuous predictor (`days_onset_hosp`). In this case we interpret the parameter estimates as the increase in the expected log of the relative hazard for each one unit increase in the predictor, holding other predictors constant. 

Which means the expected hazard is 0.9 times higher in a person who who is one day later admitted than another, holding gender constant. Or taking the inverse of the HR (`exp(-coef)` or `1/exp(coef)`), the expected hazard is 1.11 lower in a person who is admitted a day sooner.


The graphical verification of this assumption may be performed with the function `ggcoxzph()` from the *survminer* package. 

```{r coxmodel,  message=FALSE}

linelistsurv_cox <-  coxph(Surv(futime, event) ~ gender + source + days_onset_hosp, data = linelist_surv)

linelistsurv_ph_test <- cox.zph(linelistsurv_cox)
linelistsurv_ph_test
survminer::ggcoxzph(linelistsurv_ph_test)



summary(linelistsurv_cox)

```

<!-- ======================================================= -->

### Forest plots

We can then visualize the results of the cox model using the practical forest plots with the `ggforest()` function of the **survminer package**.

```{r forestp}

ggforest(linelistsurv_cox, data = linelist_surv)

```
