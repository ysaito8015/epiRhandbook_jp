# Importing data {#importdata .tabset .tabset-fade}

## Overview


Introduction to importing data


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Packages {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}  

The key package we recommend for importing data is: **rio**. **rio** offers the useful function `import()` which can import many types of files into R.  

The alternative to using **rio** would be to use functions from several other packages that are specific to a type of file (e.g. `read.csv()`, `read.xlsx()`, etc.). While these alternatives can be difficult to remember, always using `rio::import()` is relatively easy. 

Optionally, the package **here** can be used in conjunction with **rio**. It locates files on your computer via *relative pathways*, usually within the context of an [R project](#rprojects).  Relative pathways are relative from a designated folder location, so that pathways listed in R code will not break when the script is run on a different computer.

This code chunk shows the loading of packages for importing data. 

```{r import_packages}
# Checks if package is installed, installs if necessary, and loads package for current session
pacman::p_load(rio, here)

```

<!-- ======================================================= -->
## `import()` {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

When you import a dataset, you are doing the following:  

1. Creating a new, named data frame object in your R environment  
2. *Defining the new object* **as** *the imported dataset*  

The function `import()` from the package **rio** makes it easy to import many types of data files.

```{r, eval=F}
# An example:
#############
library(rio)                                                     # ensure package rio is loaded for use

# New object is defined as the imported data
my_csv_data <- import("linelist.csv")                            # importing a csv file

my_Excel_data <- import("observations.xlsx", which = "February") # import an Excel file
```

`import()` uses the file’s extension (e.g. .xlsx, .csv, .dta, etc.) to appropriately import the file. Any optional arguments specific to the filetype can be supplied as well.  

You can read more about the **rio** package [in this online vignette](https://rdrr.io/cran/rio/f/vignettes/rio.Rmd)

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** In the example above, the datasets are assumed to be located in the *working directory*, or the same folder as the script.</span>  


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Import from filepath {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}  

A filepath can be provided in full (as below) or as a *relative filepath* (see next tab). Providing a full filepath can be fast and may be the best if referencing files from a shared/network drive).  

The function `import()` (from the package **rio**) accepts a filepath in quotes. A few things to note:  

* Slashes must be forward slashes, as in the code shown. This is *NOT* the default for Windows filepaths.  
* Filepaths that begin with double slashes (e.g. "//...") will likely **not be recognized by R** and will produce an error. Consider moving these files to a "named" or "lettered" drive that begins with a letter (e.g. "J:" or "C:"). See the section on using Network Drive for more details on this issue.

```{r import_filepath, eval=F}
# A demonstration showing how to import a specific Excel sheet
my_data <- rio::import("C:/Users/Neale/Documents/my_excel_file.xlsx")
```

<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Import Excel sheet {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

If importing a specific **sheet** from an Excel file, include the sheet name in the `which = ` argument of `import()`. For example:  

```{r import_sheet, eval=F}
# A demonstration showing how to import a specific Excel sheet
my_data <- rio::import("my_excel_file.xlsx", which = "Sheetname")
```

If using the `here()` method to provide a relative pathway to `import()`, you can still indicate a specific sheet by adding the `which = ` argument after the closing parenthese of the `here()` function.  

```{r import_sheet_here, eval=F}
# Demonstration: importing a specific Excel sheet when using relative pathways with the 'here' package
linelist_raw <- import(here("data", "linelists", "linelist.xlsx"), which = "Sheet1")`  
```

<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Select file manually {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

You can import data manually via one of these methods:  

* Environment RStudio Pane, click "Import Dataset", and select the type of data 
* Click File / Import Dataset / (select the type of data)  
* To hard-code manual selection, use the *base R* command `file.choose()` (leaving the parentheses empty) to trigger appearance of a **pop-up window** that allows the user to manually select the file from their computer. For example:  

```{r import_choose, eval=F}
# A demonstration showing manual selection of a file. When this command is run, a POP-UP window should appear. 
# The filepath of the selected file will be supplied to the import() command.

my_data <- rio::import(file.choose())
```

<span style="color: darkgreen;">**_TIP:_** The **pop-up window** may appear BEHIND your RStudio window.</span>


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Relative filepaths (`here()`) {#here .tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

*Relative filepaths* differ from static filepaths in that they are *relative from a [R project](#rproject) root directory*. For example:  

* A static filepath: `import("C:/Users/nsbatra/My Documents/R files/epiproject/data/linelists/ebola_linelist.xlsx")`  
  * Specific fixed path
  * Useful if multiple users are running a script hosted on a network drive
* A relative filepath: `import(here("data", "linelists", "ebola_linelist.xlsx"))`  
  * Path is given in relation to a root directory (typically the root folder of an R project)  
  * Best if working within an R project, or planning to zip and share entire project with others  
  
The package **here** and it's function `here()` facilitate relative pathways.

`here()` works best within [R projects](#rprojects). When the **here** package is first loaded (`library(here)`), it automatically considers the top-level folder of your R project as “here” - a **benchmark** for all other files in the project.  

Thus, in your script, if you want to import or reference a file saved in your R project’s folders, you use the function `here()` to tell R where the file is ***in relation to that benchmark***.

If you are unsure where “here” is set to, run the function `here()` with the empty brackets:

```{r import_here, eval=F}
# This command tells you the folder path that "here" is set to 
here::here()
```

Below is an example of importing the file “fluH7N9_China_2013.csv” which is located in the benchmark “here” folder. All you have to do is provide the name of the file in quotes (with the appropriate ending).

```{r import_here_one, eval=F}
linelist <- import(here("fluH7N9_China_2013.csv"))
```

If the file is within a subfolder - let’s say a “data” folder - write these folder names in quotes, separated by commas, as below:
```{r import_here_mutiple, eval=F}
linelist <- import(here("data", "fluH7N9_China_2013.csv"))
```

Using the `here()` command produces a character filepath, which can then processed by the `import()` function.

```{r import_here_path, eval=F}
# the filepath
here("data", "fluH7N9_China_2013.csv")

# the filepath is given to the import() function
linelist <- import(here("data", "fluH7N9_China_2013.csv"))
```


<span style="color: black;">**_NOTE:_** You can still import a specific sheet of an excel file as noted in the Excel tab. The `here()` command only supplies the filepath.</span>



<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Manual data entry {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

### Entry by columns
Since a data frame is a combination of vertical vectors (columns), R by default expects manual entry of data to also be in vertical vectors (columns). 

```{r import_manual_col}
# define each vector (vertical column) separately, each with its own name
PatientID <- c(235, 452, 778, 111)
Treatment <- c("Yes", "No", "Yes", "Yes")
Death     <- c(1, 0, 1, 0)
```
<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** All vectors must be the same length (same number of values).</span>

The vectors can then be bound together using the function `data.frame()`:  

```{r}
# combine the columns into a data frame, by referencing the vector names
manual_entry_cols <- data.frame(PatientID, Treatment, Death)
```

And now we display the new dataset:  

```{r import_manual_colShow}
# display the new dataset
DT::datatable(manual_entry_cols)
```


### Entry by rows
Use the `tribble` function from the **tibble** package from the tidverse ([onlinetibble reference](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/tribble.html)).  
  
Note how column headers start with a *tilde* (`~`).  Also note that each column must contain only one class of data (character, numeric, etc.).  
You can use tabs, spacing, and new rows to make the data entry more intuitive and readable. For example:  

```{r import_manual_row}
# create the dataset manually by row
manual_entry_rows <- tibble::tribble(
                        ~colA, ~colB,
                        "a",   1,
                        "b",   2,
                        "c",   3
                      )
```

And now we display the new dataset:  

```{r import_manual_rowShow}
# display the new dataset
DT::datatable(manual_entry_rows)
```


### Pasting from clipboard  

If you copy data from elsewhere and have it on your clipboard, you can try the following command to convert those data into an R data frame:  

```{r, eval=F}
manual_entry_clipboard <- read.table(file = "clipboard",
                                     sep = "t",           # separator could be tab, or commas, etc.
                                     header=TRUE)         # if there is a header row
```
