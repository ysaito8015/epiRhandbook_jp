# Working with Dates {.tabset .tabset-fade}


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Overview

Working with dates in `R` is notoriously difficult when compared to other object classes. `R` often interprets dates as character objects - this means they cannot be used for general date operations such as making time series and calculating time intervals. To make matters more difficult, there are many date formats, some of which can be confused for other formats. Luckily, dates can be wrangled easily with practice, and with a set of helpful packages.

Dates in `R` are their own class of object - the `Date` class. It should be noted that there is also a class that stores objects with date *and* time. Date time objects are formally referred to as  and/or `POSIXt`, `POSIXct`, and/or `POSIXlt` classes (the difference isn't important). These objects are informally referred to as *datetime* classes.

You can get the system date or system datetime by doing the following:

```{r eval=T}
# get the system date - this is a DATE class
Sys.Date()

# get the system time - this is a DATETIME class
Sys.time()

```

* It is important to make R recognize when a variable contains dates.  
* Dates are an object class and can be tricky to work with.  
* Here we present several ways to convert date variables to Date class.  


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Packages

The following packages are recommended for working with dates:  

```{r dates_packages}
# Checks if package is installed, installs if necessary, and loads package for current session

pacman::p_load(aweek,      # flexibly converts dates to weeks, and vis-versa
               lubridate,  # for conversions to months, years, etc.
               linelist,   # function to guess messy dates
               ISOweek)    # another option for creating weeks
```



<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Converting objects to Date class

The standard, **base** R function to convert an object or variable to class Date is `as.Date()` (note capitalization).  

`as.Date()` requires that the user *specify the ***existing*** format of the date*, so it can understand, convert, and store each element (day, month, year, etc.) correctly. [Read more online about `as.Date()`](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~s133/dates.html).  

**If used on a variable, `as.Date()` therefore requires that all the character date values be in the same format before converting.** If your data are messy, try cleaning them or consider using `guess_dates()` from the **linelist** package.  

It can be easiest to first convert the variable to character class, and then convert to date class:  

  1. Turn the variable into character values using the function `as.character()`
```{r eval=F}
linelist_cleaned$date_of_onset <- as.character(linelist_cleaned$date_of_onset)
```
  2. Convert the variable from character values into date values, using the function `as.Date()`  
  (note the capital "D")  
  + Within the `as.Date()` function, you must use the `format=` argument to tell R the *current* format of the date components - which characters refer to the month, the day, and the year, and how they are separated. If your values are already in one of R's standard date formats (YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY/MM/DD) the `format=` argument is not necessary.  
    
    + The codes are:  
         %d = Day # (of the month e.g. 16, 17, 18...)  
         %a = abbreviated weekday (Mon, Tues, Wed, etc.)  
         %A = full weekday (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)  
         %m = # of month (e.g. 01, 02, 03, 04)  
         %b = abbreviated month (Jan, Feb, etc.)  
         %B = Full Month (January, February, etc.)  
         %y = 2-digit year  (e.g. 89)  
         %Y = 4-digit year  (e.g. 1989)  

For example, if your character dates are in the format DD/MM/YYYY, like "24/04/1968", then your command to turn the values into dates will be as below. **Putting the format in quotation marks is necessary.**  
```{r eval=F}
linelist_cleaned$date_of_onset <- as.Date(linelist_cleaned$date_of_onset, format = "%d/%m/%Y")
```
<span style="color: darkgreen;">**_TIP:_** The `format =` argument is *not* telling R the format you want the dates to be, but rather how to identify the date parts as they are *before* you run the command.</span>  

<span style="color: darkgreen;">**_TIP:_**Be sure that in the `format =` argument you use the *date-part separator* (e.g. /, -, or space) that is present in your dates.</span>  


Conveting character objects to dates can be made *far* easier by using the lubridate package. The `lubridate` package is a `tidyverse` package designed to make working with dates and time more simple and consistent than in base R. For these reasons, `lubridate` is often considered the gold-standard package for dates and time, and is recommended whenever working with them.

The `lubridate` package provides a number of different helper functions designed to convert character objects to dates in an intuitive, and more lenient way than specifying the format in `as.Date()`. These functions are specific to the rough date format, but allow for a variety of separators, and synonyms for dates (e.g. 01 vs Jan vs January) - they are named after abbreviations of date formats. 


```{r, eval = T}
# load packages 
library(lubridate)

# read date in year-month-day format
ymd("2020-10-11")
ymd("20201011")

# read date in month-day-year format
mdy("10/11/2020")
mdy("Oct 11 20")

# read date in day-month-year format
dmy("11 10 2020")
dmy("11 October 2020")
```

<!-- The `as.character()` and `as.Date()` commands can optionally be combined as:   -->

<!-- ```{r eval=F} -->
<!-- linelist_cleaned$date_of_onset <- as.Date(as.character(linelist_cleaned$date_of_onset), format = "%d/%m/%Y") -->
<!-- ``` -->

If using [piping](#piping) and the tidyverse, the converting a character column to dates might look like this:  

```{r, eval=F}
linelist_cleaned <- linelist_cleaned %>%
  mutate(date_of_onset = lubridate::dmy(date_of_onset))
```

Once complete, you can run a command to verify the class of the variable
```{r, eval=F}
# Check the class of the variable
class(linelist_cleaned$date_of_onset)  
```

Once the values are in class Date, R will by default display them in the standard format, which is YYYY-MM-DD.

<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Converting to `datetime` classes

As previously mentioned, R also supports a `datetime` class - a variable that contains date **and** time information. As with the `Date` class, these often need to be converted from `character` objects to `datetime` objects. 

A standard `datetime` object is formatted with the date first, which is followed by a time component - for example  _01 Jan 2020, 16:30_. As with dates, there are many ways this can be formatted, and there are numerous levels of precision (hours, minutes, seconds) that can be supplied. Luckily, lubridate helper functions also exist to help convert these strings to `datetime` objects. These functions are the same as the date helper functions, with `_h` (only hours supplied), `_hm` (hours and minutes supplied), or `_hms` (hours, minutes, and seconds supplied) appended to the end (e.g. `dmy_hms()`). These can be used as shown:

```{r, eval = TRUE}

# convert datetime with only hours to datetime object
ymd_h("2020-01-01 16hrs")
ymd_h("2020-01-01 4PM")


# convert datetime with hours and minutes to datetime object
dmy_hm("Jan 1st 2020 16:20")

# convert datetime with hours, minutes, and seconds to datetime object
mdy_hms("01 January 20, 16:20:40")
# you can supply time zone but it is ignored
mdy_hms("01 January 20, 16:20:40 PST")

```

When working with a linelist, time and date columns can be combined to create a datetime column using these functions:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# time_admission is a variable in hours:minutes
linelist_cleaned <- linelist_cleaned %>%
  # assume that when time of admission is not given, it the median admission time
  mutate(
    time_admission_clean = ifelse(
      is.na(time_admission),
      median(time_admission),
      time_admission
  ) %>%
  # use paste0 to combine two columns to create a character vector, and use ymd_hm() to convert to datetime
  mutate(
    date_time_of_admission = paste0(
      date_hospitalisation, time_admission_clean, sep = " "
    ) %>% ymd_hm()
  )

```
<!-- ======================================================= -->
## lubridate  

`lubridate` can also be used for a variety of other functions, such as **extracting aspects of a date/datetime**, **performing date arithmetic**, or **calculating date intervals**

```{r, eval = T}
  # extract the month from this date
  
  example_date <- ymd("2020-03-01")
  
  # extract the month and year from this date
  month(example_date)
  year(example_date)
  
  # get the epiweek of this date (this will be expanded later)
  epiweek(example_date)
  # get the day of the week for this date (this will be expanded later)
  wday(example_date)
  
  # add 3 days to this date
  example_date + days(3)
  
  # add 7 weeks and subtract two days from this date
  example_date + weeks(7) - days(2)
  
  
  # find the interval between this date and Feb 20 2020 
  
  example_date - ymd("2020-02-20")
  
```

This can all be brought together to work with data - for example:

```{r, eval = F}
library(lubridate)

linelist_cleaned <- linelist_cleaned %>%
    # convert date of onset from character to date objects by specifying dmy format
    mutate(date_of_onset = dmy(date_of_onset),
           date_of_hospitalisation = dmy(date_of_hospitalisation)) %>%
    # filter out all cases without onset in march
    filter(month(date_of_onset) == 3) %>%
    # find the difference in days between onset and hospitalisation
    mutate(onset_to_hosp_days = date_of_hospitalisation - date_of_onset)

```



<!-- ======================================================= -->
## `guess_dates()` 

**The function `guess_dates()` attempts to read a "messy" date variable containing dates in many different formats and convert the dates to a standard format.** You can [read more online about `guess_dates()`](https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/linelist/reference/guess_dates.html), which is in the **linelist** package.

>**For example:** `guess_dates` would see the following dates "03 Jan 2018", "07/03/1982", and "08/20/85" and convert them in the class Date to: 2018-01-03, 1982-03-07, and 1985-08-20.  

```{r, eval = F}
linelist::guess_dates(c("03 Jan 2018", "07/03/1982", "08/20/85")) # guess_dates() not yet available on CRAN for R 4.0.2
                                                                  # try install via devtools::install_github("reconhub/linelist")
```

*Some optional arguments for `guess_dates()` that you might include are:*  

* `error_tolerance` - The proportion of entries which cannot be identified as dates to be tolerated (defaults to 0.1 or 10%)
* `last_date` - the last valid date (defaults to current date)  
* `first_date` - the first valid date. Defaults to fifty years before the last_date.


```{r eval = FALSE}
# An example using guess_dates on the variable dtdeath
data_cleaned <- data %>% 
  mutate(
    dtdeath = linelist::guess_dates(
      dtdeath, error_tolerance = 0.1, first_date = "2016-01-01"
    )
```


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Excel Dates

Excel stores dates as the number of days since December 30, 1899. If the dataset you imported from Excel shows dates as numbers or characters like "41369"... use the `as.Date()` or `as_date()` function to convert, but **instead of supplying a format as above, supply an origin date**. This will not work if the excel date is read as a character type, so be sure to ensure the date is a numeric class (or convert it to one)!

<span style="color: black;">**_NOTE:_** You should provide the origin date in R's default date format (`"YYYY-MM-DD"`).</span>


```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)

# An example of providing the Excel 'origin date' when converting Excel number dates
data_cleaned <- data %>% 
  mutate(date_of_onset = as_date(as.double(date_of_onset), origin = "1899-12-30"))
```


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## How dates are displayed  

Once dates are the correct class, you often want them to display differently (e.g. in a plot, graph, or table). For example, to display as "Monday 05 Jan" instead of 2018-01-05. You can do this with the function `format()`, which works in a similar way as `as.Date()`. Read more [in this online tutorial](https://www.statmethods.net/input/dates.html). Remember that the output from `format()` is a character type, so is generally used for display purposes only!

%d = Day # (of the month e.g. 16, 17, 18...)
%a = abbreviated weekday (Mon, Tues, Wed, etc.)  
%A = full weekday (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)  
%m = # of month (e.g. 01, 02, 03, 04)  
%b = abbreviated month (Jan, Feb, etc.)  
%B = Full Month (January, February, etc.)  
%y = 2-digit year  (e.g. 89)  
%Y = 4-digit year  (e.g. 1989)  
%h = hours (24-hr clock)  
%m = minutes  
%s = seconds
%z = offset from GMT  
%Z = Time zone (character)

An example of formatting today's date:  

```{r}
# today's date, with formatting
format(Sys.Date(), format = "%d %B %Y")

# easy way to get full date and time (no formatting)
date()

# formatted date, time, and time zone (using paste0() function)
paste0(
  format(Sys.Date(), format = "%A, %b %d '%y, %z  %Z, "), 
  format(Sys.time(), format = "%H:%M:%S")
)
```

<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Calculating distance between dates

The difference between dates can be calculated by:  
  
  
1. Correctly formating *both* date variable as class date (see instructions above)  
2. Creating a new variable that is defined as one date variable subtracted from the other
3. Converting the result to numeric class (default is class "datediff"). This ensures that subsequent mathematical calculations can be performed.  


```{r, eval = TRUE}

# define variables as date classes
date_of_onset <- ymd("2020-03-16")
date_lab_confirmation <- ymd("2020-03-20")

# find the delay between onset and lab confirmation
days_to_lab_conf <- as.double(date_lab_confirmation - date_of_onset)
days_to_lab_conf

```

In a dataframe format (i.e. when working with a linelist), if either of the above dates is missing, the operation will fail for that row. This will result in an `NA` instead of a numeric value. When using this column for calculations, be sure to set the `na.rm` option to `TRUE`. For example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# add a new column
# calculating the number of days between symptom onset and patient outcome
linelist_delay <- linelist_cleaned %>%
  mutate(
    days_onset_to_outcome = as.double(date_of_outcome - date_of_onset)
  )

# calculate the median number of days to outcome for all cases where data are available
med_days_outcome <- median(linelist_delay$dats_onset_to_outcome, na.rm = T)

# often this operation might be done only on a subset of data cases, e.g. those who died
# this is easy to look at and will be explained later in the handbook

```

<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Converting dates/time zones

When data is present in different time time zones, it can often be important to standardise this data in a unified time zone. This can present a further challenge, as the time zone component of data must be coded manually in most cases.

In R, each *datetime* object has a timezone component. By default, all datetime objects will carry the local time zone for the computer being used - this is generally specific to a *location* rather than a named timezone, as time zones will often change in locations due to daylight savings time. It is not possible to accurately compensate for time zones without a time component of a date, as the event a date variable represents cannot be attributed to a specific time, and therefore time shifts measured in hours cannot be reasonably accounted for.

To deal with time zones, there are a number of helper functions in lubridate that can be used to change the time zone of a datetime object from the local time zone to a different time zone. Time zones are set by attributing a valid tz database time zone to the datetime object. A list of these can be found here - if the location you are using data from is not on this list, nearby large cities in the time zone are available and serve the same purpose. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones


```{r}
# assign the current time to a variable
time_now <- Sys.time()
time_now

# use with_tz() to assign a new timezone to the variable, while CHANGING the clock time
time_london_real <- with_tz(time_now, "Europe/London")

# use force_tz() to assign a new timezone to the variable, while KEEPING the clock time
time_london_local <- force_tz(time_now, "Europe/London")


# note that as long as the computer that was used to run this code is NOT set to London time, there will be a difference in the times (the number of hours difference from the computers time zone to london)

time_london_real - time_london_local

```

This may seem largely abstract, and is often not needed if the user isn't working across time zones. One simple example of its implementation is:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# TODO add when time variable is here
# set the time variable to time zone for ebola outbreak 

# "Africa/Lubumbashi" is the time zone for eastern DRC/Kivu Nord


```
