## Overview {.tabset .tabset-fade}

This page lists common errors and suggests solutions for troubleshooting them


### Data management errors  



```
No such file or directory:
```
If you see an error like this when you try to export or import: Check the spelling of the file and filepath, and if the path contains slashes make sure they are forward `/` and not backward `\`. Also make sure you used the correct file extension (e.g. .csv, .xlsx).  



```
#Tried to add a value ("Missing") to a factor (with replace_na operating on a factor)
Problem with `mutate()` input `age_cat`.
i invalid factor level, NA generated
i Input `age_cat` is `replace_na(age_cat, "Missing")`.invalid factor level, NA generated
```

You likely have a column of class Factor (which contains pre-defined levels) and tried to add a new value to it. Convert it to class Character before adding a new value.  





### Plotting errors  


```
# ran recode without re-stating the x variable in mutate(x = recode(x, OLD = NEW)
Error: Problem with `mutate()` input `hospital`.
x argument ".x" is missing, with no default
i Input `hospital` is `recode(...)`.
```


`Error: Insufficient values in manual scale. 3 needed but only 2 provided.`
ggplot() scale_fill_manual() values = c("orange", "purple") ... insufficient for number of factor levels ... consider whether NA is now a factor level...


```
Error: unexpected symbol in:
"  geom_histogram(stat = "identity")+
  tidyquant::geom_ma(n=7, size = 2, color = "red" lty"
```
If you see "unexpected symbol" check for missing commas
