# Plot continuous data { }  

This page will discuss appropriate plotting of continuous data, such as age, clinical measurements, and distance. We focus on use of **ggplot2** (part of the **tidyverse** family of packages), but also brielfly describe **base** R plotting functions.  

Visualisations covered here include:

* Plots for one continuous variable:  
  * **Histogram**, a classic graph to present the distribution of a continuous variable. 
  * **Box plot** (also called box and whisker), to show the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, tail ends of the distribution, and outliers ([important limitations](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/boxplot.html)).  
  * **Jitter plot**, to show all values as points that are 'jittered' so they can (mostly) all be seen, even where two have the same value.  
  * **Violin plot**, show the distribution of a continuous variable based on the symmetrical width of the 'violin'. 
  * **Sina plot**, are a combination of jitter and violin plots, where individual points are shown but in the symmetrical shape of the distribution (via **ggforce** package).  
* **Scatter plot** for two continuous variables.  
* **Heat plots** for three continuous variables (linked to [Heat plots] page)

<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Preparation {  }

Preparation includes loading the relevant packages, here **ggplot2** and **dplyr** (both part of **tidyverse**), and ensuring your data columsn are of the correct class. 

### Load packages {-}

This code chunk shows the loading of packages required for the analyses. In this handbook we emphasize `p_load()` from **pacman**, which installs the package if necessary *and* loads it for use. You can also load installed packages with  `library()` from **base** R. See the page on [R basics] for more information on R packages.  

Note: The mega-package **tidyverse** includes the pacakage **ggplot2** and **dplyr** among many others (e.g. **stringr**, **tidyr**, and **forcats**).  

```{r}
pacman::p_load(
  rio,            # data import and export
  here,           # relative file paths
  tidyverse       # includes ggplot2 and dplyr
  )
```



### Import data {-}

For the examples in this section, we will use the dataset of cases from a simulated Ebola epidemic. If you want to download the data to follow step-by-step, see instructions in the [Download handbook and data] page. The dataset is imported using the `import()` function from the **rio** package. See the page on [Import and export] for various ways to import data.

```{r, echo=F}
# import the linelist into R
linelist <- rio::import(here::here("data", "case_linelists", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))
```

```{r, eval=F}
# import the linelist
linelist <- import("linelist_cleaned.xlsx")
```

The first 50 rows of the linelist are displayed below. We will focus on the continuous variables `age`, `wt_kg` (weight in kilos), `ct_blood` (CT, cycle-threshold values), and `days_onset_hosp` (difference between date of symptom onset and date of hospitalisation).  

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(head(linelist, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```





### Column class {-}  

Ensure that the continuous columns are correcly classified in R as class Numeric. Below we use `mutate()` and `as.numeric()`to ensure the class of the columns that are important to our analysis. The the page on [Cleaning data and core functions] for more detail.  

```{r}
linelist <- linelist %>%  
  mutate(                                          # Ensure vars are class numeric
    age = as.numeric(age),       
    ct_blood = as.numeric(ct_blood),
    days_onset_hosp = as.numeric(days_onset_hosp),
    wt_kg = as.numeric(wt_kg))  
```

Note: You should have conducted various data checks before this point, including checking the missingness of the data. See the page [Missing data] for tips on these analyses.  





## One continuous variable  



### Histograms {-}

Below is code for generating **histograms**, which group continuous data into ranges and display in adjacent bars of varying height. This is done using `geom_histogram()`. See the section in [Plot categorical data] to understand difference between `geom_histogram()`, `geom_bar()`, and `geom_col()`.  

We will show the distribution of ages of cases. Within `aes()` specify which column you want to see the distribution of. You can assign this column to either the x or the y axis. 

For the plot, the cases will be assigned to "bins" which will be represented by bars. If the number of bins (`bins = ` in `geom_histogram()`) is unspecified, R will guess an appropriate number of bins and print this message to let you know:  

```
## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
``` 

Alternatively, you can specify `binwidth = ` within `geom_histogram()` to specify the range of values that the bin includes. In contrast, if using `bins = ` the break points are evenly spaced between the minimum and maximum values of the histogram. We give a few examples showing different bins and bin widths. 

```{r fig.show='hold', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width=c('50%', '50%')}
# A) Regular histogram
ggplot(data = linelist, aes(x = age))+  # provide x variable
  geom_histogram()+
  labs(title = "A) Default histogram (30 bins)")

# B) More bins
ggplot(data = linelist, aes(x = age))+  # provide x variable
  geom_histogram(bins = 50)+
  labs(title = "B) Set to 50 bins")

# C) Fewer bins
ggplot(data = linelist, aes(x = age))+  # provide x variable
  geom_histogram(bins = 5)+
  labs(title = "C) Set to 5 bins")


# C) More bins
ggplot(data = linelist, aes(x = age))+  # provide x variable
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)+
  labs(title = "D) binwidth of 1")

```


Rather than counts, you can change the stats within the `aes()` bracket to specify proportions - see (plot A) below. You can also layer different histograms with different settings (plot B).

```{r, fig.show='hold', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width=c('50%', '50%')}
# A) Histogram with proportion
ggplot(data = linelist, aes(x = ct_blood,           # provide x variable
                            y = stat(density)))+    # Calculate proportion
  geom_histogram(bins=10,                           # Add bin number
                 color = "white")+ # Add white outline so bars can easily be distinguished
  labs(title = "A) Ggplot histogram showing proportion")

# B) Layered histograms with different bin widths
ggplot(data = linelist, aes(x = ct_blood))+         # provide x variable 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2) +                    # Underlying layer has binwidth of 2
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1,                      # Top layer has binwidth of 1
                 alpha = 0.4,                       # Set top layer to be slightly see through
                 fill = "blue")+ 
  labs(title = "B) Layered ggplot histograms")
```

To get a "stacked" histogram (of a continuous column of data), you can do one of the following:  

1) Use `geom_histogram()` with the `fill = ` argument within `aes()` and assigned to the grouping column, or  
2) Use `geom_freqpoly()`, which is likely easier to read than the above option. You can still set `binwidth = ` etc.  
3) To see proportions of all values, , set the `y = after_stat(density)` (use this syntax exactly - not changed for your data)  
  * Note these proportions will show *per group*  
4) To get smoothed proportions, you can use `geom_density()`


Each is shown below (*note use of `color = ` vs. `fill = ` in each):  

```{r, fig.show='hold', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width=c('50%', '50%')}
# "Stacked" histogram
ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age, fill = gender)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2)+
  labs(title = "'Stacked' histogram")

# Frequency 
ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age, color = gender)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 2, size = 2)+
  labs(title = "Freqpoly")

# Frequency with proportion axis
ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age, y = after_stat(density), color = gender)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 5, size = 2)+
  labs(title = "Proportional freqpoly")

# Frequency with proportion axis, smoothed
ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age, y = after_stat(density), fill = gender)) +
  geom_density(binwidth = 2, size = 2, alpha = 0.2)+
  labs(title = "Proportional, smoothed with geom_density()")
```

If you want to have some fun, try `geom_density_ridges` from the **ggridges** package ([vignette here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html).  

Read more in detail about histograms at the **tidyverse** [page on geom_histogram()](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_histogram.html).  



### Box plots {-}

Box plots are common, but have important limitations. They can obscure the actual distribution - e.g. a bi-modal distribution. See this [R graph gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/boxplot.html) and this [data-to-viz article](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/boxplot.html) for more details. However, they do nicely display the inter-quartile range and outliers - so they can be overlaid on top of other types of plots that show the distribution in more detail.  

Below is the box plot anatomy ([image source](https://www.leansigmacorporation.com/box-plot-with-minitab/)).  

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "boxplot.png"))
```


When using `geom_boxplot()` to create a box plot, you generally map only one axis (x or y) within `aes()`. The axis specified determines if the plots are horizontal or vertical. 

In most geoms, you create a plot per group by mapping an aesthetic like `color = ` or `fill = ` to a column within `aes()`. However, for box plots achieve this by assigning the grouping column to the un-assigned axis (x or y). Below is code for a boxplot of *all* age values in the dataset, and second is code to display one box plot for each (non-missing) gender in the dataset. Note that 'NA' (missing) values will appear as a separate box plot unless removed. In this example we also set the `fill` to the column `outcome` so each plot is a different color - but this is not necessary.  

```{r fig.show='hold', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width=c('50%', '50%')}
# A) Overall boxplot
ggplot(data = linelist)+  
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(y = age))+   # only y axis mapped (not x)
  labs(title = "A) Overall boxplot")

# B) Box plot by group
ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(y = age, x = gender, fill = gender)) + 
  geom_boxplot()+                      
  labs(title = "B) Boxplot by gender")      
```

For code to add a box plot to the edges of a scatter plot ("marginal" plots) see the page [ggplot tips].  





### Violin, jitter, and sina plots {-}

Below is code for creating **violin plots** (`geom_violin`) and **jitter plots** (`geom_jitter`) to show age distributions. You can specify that the fill or color is also determined by the data, thereby inserting these options within `aes()`. 

```{r fig.show='hold', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width=c('50%', '50%')}


# A) Jitter plot by group
ggplot(data = linelist %>% filter(!is.na(outcome)), 
       mapping = aes(y = age,                     # Continuous variable
           x = outcome,                           # Grouping variable
           color = outcome))+                     # Color variable
  geom_jitter()+                                  # Create the violin plot
  labs(title = "A) jitter plot by gender")     



# B) Violin plot by group
ggplot(data = linelist %>% filter(!is.na(outcome)), 
       mapping = aes(y = age,                      # Continuous variable
           x = outcome,                            # Grouping variable
           fill = outcome))+                       # fill variable (color)
  geom_violin()+                                   # create the violin plot
  labs(title = "B) violin plot by gender")    


```

One can combine the two using the `geom_sina()` function from the **ggforce** package. This can be easier to visually interpret. A) on the left shows basic layering of both a `geom_violin()` and `geom_sina()`. B) shows slightly more effort put into the appearance of the ggplot (see in-line comments). 

```{r fig.show='hold', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width=c('50%', '50%')}

pacman::p_load(ggforce)

# A) Sina plot by group
ggplot(data = linelist %>% filter(!is.na(outcome)), 
       aes(y = age,             # numeric variable
           x = outcome)) +      # group variable
  geom_violin()+                # create the violin plot
  geom_sina()+
  labs(title = "A) violin and sina plot by gender")      


# A) Sina plot by group
ggplot(data = linelist %>% filter(!is.na(outcome)), 
       aes(y = age,             # numeric variable
           x = outcome)) +      # group variable
  geom_violin(aes(fill = outcome), # fill variable (color of violin background)
              color = "white",  # Plot has white outline rather than default black 
              alpha = 0.2)+     # Alpha value where 0 transparent to 1 opaque
  geom_sina(size=1,             # Change the size of the jitter
            aes(color = outcome))+ # color variable (color of dots)
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Death" = "#bf5300", 
                        "Recover" = "#11118c")) + # Define colours for death/recover 
                                                  # (but note they will come out a bit transparent)
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Death" = "#bf5300", 
                         "Recover" = "#11118c")) + # Define colours for death/recover
  theme_minimal() +                                # Remove the gray background
  theme(legend.position = "none") +                # Remove unnecessary legend
  labs(title = "B) violin and sina plot by gender, with extra formatting")      



```



<!-- ### One continuous variable within facets {-} -->

<!-- **Faceting basics**  -->

<!-- To examine further subgroups, one can 'facet' the graph. This means the plot will be recreated within specified subgroups. One can use: -->

<!-- * `facet_wrap()` - this will recreate the sub-graphs and present them alphabetically (typically, unless stated otherwise). You can invoke certain options to determine the look of the facets, e.g. `nrow=1` or `ncol=1` to control the number of rows or columns that the faceted plots are arranged within. See plot A below.  -->
<!-- * `facet_grid()` - this is suited to seeing subgroups for particular combinations of discrete variables. See plot B  below. `nrow` and `ncol` are not relevant, as the subgroups are presented in a grid, with the subgroups always in the x or y axis (see notes in code below) -->

<!-- You can stipulate up to two faceting variables, with a '~' between them. If only one faceting variable, a '.' is used as a placeholder for a non-used second faceting variable - see code examples. -->

<!-- ```{r fig.show='hold', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width=c('50%', '50%')} -->
<!-- # A) Histogram of hospitalisation dates faceted by hospital -->
<!-- ggplot(data = linelist %>%  -->
<!--          filter(hospital != "Missing"),               # filter removes unknown hospital -->
<!--        aes(x = date_hospitalisation ))+ -->
<!--   geom_histogram(binwidth=7) +                        # Bindwidth = 7 days -->
<!--   labs(title = "A) 2 histogram of hospitalisation dates by hospital")+ -->
<!--   facet_wrap(hospital~.,                              # Facet by just hospital -->
<!--             ncol = 2)                                 # Facet in two columns -->

<!-- # B) Boxplot of age faceted in a grid with two variables, gender and outcome -->
<!-- ggplot(data = linelist %>%  -->
<!--          filter(!is.na(gender) & !is.na(outcome)),    # filter retains non-missing gender/outcome -->
<!--        aes(y = age))+ -->
<!--   geom_boxplot()+ -->
<!--   labs(title = "A) A boxplot by gender and outcome")+ -->
<!--   facet_grid(outcome~gender)                          # Outcome is the row, gender is the column -->

<!-- ``` -->


## Two continuous variables  

Following similar syntax, `geom_point()` will allow one to plot two continuous variables against eachother in a **scatter plot**. This is useful for showing actual values rather than their distributions.

A basic scatter plot of age vs weight is shown in (A). In (B) we again use `facet_grid()` to show the relationship between two continuous variables in the linelist. 

```{r fig.show='hold', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width=c('50%', '50%')}
# Basic scatter plot of weight and age
ggplot(data = linelist, 
       aes(y = wt_kg, x = age))+
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "A) Scatter plot of weight and age")

# Scatter plot of weight and age by gender and Ebola outcome
ggplot(data = linelist %>% filter(!is.na(gender) & !is.na(outcome)), # filter retains non-missing gender/outcome
       aes(y = wt_kg, x = age))+
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "B) Scatter plot of weight and age faceted by gender and outcome")+
  facet_grid(gender~outcome) 

```


### Three continuous variables {-}  

UNDER CONSTRUCTION




<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Plotting with base graphics {  }

Using base graphics can sometimes be quicker than ggplot, and is helpful for that initial first look.

### One continuous variable {-}

#### Box plots and histograms {-}

The in-built graphics package comes with the `boxplot()` and `hist()` functions, allowing straight-forward visualisation of a continuous variable. 

```{r, fig.show='hold', out.width=c('50%', '50%')}

# Boxplot
boxplot(linelist$wt_kg,
                  main = "A) Base boxplot") 


# Histogram
hist(linelist$wt_kg,
                  main = "B) Base histogram") 

```

**Further customisation**

Subgroups can also be shown, by subgroup or crossed groups. Note how with plot B below,  ```outcome``` and ```gender``` are written as ```outcome*gender``` such that the boxplots are for the four combinations of the two columns. They do not get facetted across different rows and columns like in ggplot2.

We specify `linelist` as the dataset so we do not need to write `age` as `linelist$age`
```{r, fig.show='hold', out.width=c('50%', '50%')}

# Box plot by subgroup
boxplot(age ~ outcome,
                  data = linelist, 
                  main = "A) Base boxplot by subgroup")

# Box plot by crossed subgroups
boxplot(age ~ outcome*gender,
                  data = linelist, 
                  main = "B) Base boxplot) by crossed groups")

```

Some further options with `boxplot()` shown below are:  

* Boxplot width proportional to sample size (A)
* Violin plots, with notched representing the median and x around it (B)
* Horizontal (C)  


```{r, out.width=c('33%', '33%', '33%'), fig.show='hold'}

# Varying width by sample size 
boxplot(linelist$age ~ linelist$outcome,
                  varwidth = TRUE, # width varying by sample size
                  main="A) Proportional boxplot() widths")

                  
# Notched (violin plot), and varying width
boxplot(age ~ outcome,
        data=linelist,
        notch=TRUE,      # notch at median
        main="B) Notched boxplot()",
        col=(c("gold","darkgreen")),
        xlab="Suppliment and Dose")

# Horizontal
boxplot(age ~ outcome,
        data=linelist,
        horizontal=TRUE,  # flip to horizontal
        col=(c("gold","darkgreen")),
        main="C) Horizontal boxplot()",
        xlab="Suppliment and Dose")
```

### Two continuous variables {-}

Using base R, we can quickly visualise the relationship between two continuous variables with the `plot` function.


```{r}
plot(linelist$age, linelist$wt_kg)
```
