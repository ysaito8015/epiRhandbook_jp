# Datasets used

Data used in this handbook are either simulated or publicly available. All can be accessed from the ["data" folder](https://github.com/nsbatra/Epi_R_handbook/tree/master/data) of our Github repository.  

The case linelist used throughout much of the handbook is a *simulated* Ebola outbreak dataset from the **outbreaks** package.
