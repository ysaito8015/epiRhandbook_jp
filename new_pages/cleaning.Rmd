## Overview {.tabset .tabset-fade } 

This page demonstrates common steps necessary to clean a dataset, starting with importing raw data and demonstrating a "pipe chain" of cleaning steps. This page uses a simulated Ebola case linelist, which is referenced throughout the handbook.  

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "cleaning_dataset_snip.png"))
```

<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Preparation

### Load packages  

```{r}
pacman::p_load(
  janitor,    # data cleaning
  rio,        # importing data
  epikit,     # age_categories() function
  tidyverse,  # data manipulation and visualization
)
```

### Load data  

Import the raw dataset using the `import()` function from the package **rio**.  (LINK HERE TO IMPORT PAGE)  

```{r, echo=F, message=F}
# HIDDEN FROM READER
# actually load the data using here()
linelist_raw <- rio::import(here::here("data", "linelist_raw.xlsx"))
```

```{r, eval=F}
linelist_raw <- import("linelist_raw.xlsx")
```

You can view the first 50 rows of the the original "raw" dataset below: 

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(head(linelist_raw,50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T) )
```




<!-- ======================================================= -->
<!-- ======================================================= -->
<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Cleaning pipeline

In epidemiological analysis and data processing, cleaning steps are often performed linked together, sequentially. In R this often manifests as a cleaning "pipeline", where the raw dataset is passed or "piped" from one cleaning step to another. The chain utilizes **dplyr** verbs and the **magrittr** pipe operator (see handbook page on **dplyr** and tidyverse coding style (LINK HERE). The pipe begins with the "raw" data (`linelist_raw`) and ends with a "clean" dataset (`linelist`).  

In a cleaning pipeline the order of the steps is important. Cleaning steps might include:  

* Importing of data  
* Column names cleaned or changed  
* Rows filtered, added, or de-duplicated  
* Columns selected, added, transformed, or re-ordered  
* Values re-coded, cleaned, or grouped  



<!-- ======================================================= -->
<!-- ======================================================= -->
<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Column names {.tabset .tabset-fade } 

Column names are used very often so they need to have "clean" syntax. We suggest the following:  

* Short names
* No spaces (replaced with underscores (_), 
* No unusual characters (&, #...)  
* Similar style nomenclature (e.g. all date columns named like **date_**onset, **date_**report, **date_**death...)  

The columns names of `linelist_raw` are below. We can see that there are some with spaces. We also have different naming patterns for dates ('date onset' and 'infection date').  

Also note that in the raw data, the two final columns names were two merged cells with one name. The `import()` function used the name for the first of the two columns, and assigned the second column the name "...23" as it was then empty (referring to the 23rd column).  


```{r}
names(linelist_raw)
```

Note: For a column name that include spaces, surround the name with back-ticks, for example: linelist$`infection date`. On a keyboard, the back-tick (`) is different from the single quotation mark ('), and is sometimes on the same key as the tilde (~).


### Automatic colummn name cleaning  

The function `clean_names()` from the package **janitor** standardizes column names and makes them unique by doing the following:  

* Converts all names to consist of only underscores, numbers, and letters  
* Accented characters are transliterated to ASCII (e.g. german o with umlaut becomes "o", spanish "enye" becomes "n")  
* Capitalization preference can be specified using the `case = ` argument ("snake" is default, alternatives include "sentence", "title", "small_camel"...)  
* You can designate specific name replacements with the `replace = ` argument (e.g. replace = c(onset = "date_of_onset"))  
* Here is an online [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/janitor.html#cleaning)  

Below, the cleaning pipeline begins by using `clean_names()` on the raw linelist.  

```{r clean_names}
# send the dataset through the function clean_names()
linelist <- linelist_raw %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

# see the new names
names(linelist)
```

<span style="color: black;">**_NOTE:_** The column name "...28" was changed to "x28".</span>


### Manual column name cleaning  

Re-naming columns manually is often necessary. Below, re-naming is performed using the `rename()` function from the **dplyr** package, as part of a pipe chain. `rename()` uses the style "NEW = OLD", the new column name is given before the old column name.  

Below, a re-name command is added to the cleaning pipeline:  

```{r}
# CLEANING 'PIPE' CHAIN (starts with raw data and pipes it through cleaning steps)
##################################################################################
linelist <- linelist_raw %>%
    
    # standardize column name syntax
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    
    # manually re-name columns
           # NEW name             # OLD name
    rename(date_infection       = infection_date,
           date_hospitalisation = hosp_date,
           date_outcome         = date_of_outcome)
```



**Now you can see that the columns names have been changed:**  

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(head(linelist,50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T) )
```

#### Rename by column position  

You can also rename by column position, instead of column name, for example:  

```{r, eval=F}
rename(newNameForFirstColumn = 1,
       newNameForSecondColumn = 2)
```

#### Empty Excel column names  

If you importing an Excel sheet with a missing column name, depending on the import function used, R will likely create a column name with a value like "...1" or "...2". You can clean these names manually by referencing their position number (see above), or their name (`linelist_raw$...1`).  


### Merged Excel column names  
<h3> Merged Excel column names </h3>

Merged cells in an Excel file are a common occurrence when receiving data from field level. Merged cells can be nice for human reading of data, but cause many problems for machine reading of data. R cannot accommodate merged cells. 

Remind people doing data entry that **human-readable data is not the same as machine-readable data**. Strive to train users about the princiles of [**tidy data**](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html). If at all possible, try to change procedures so that data arrive in a tidy format without merged cells.  

* Each variable must have its own column.  
* Each observation must have its own row.  
* Each value must have its own cell.  

When using **rio**'s `import()` function, the value in a merged cell will be assigned to the first cell and subsequent cells will be empty.  

One solution to deal with merged cells is to import the data with the function `readWorkbook()` from package **openxlsx**. Set the argument `fillMergedCells = TRUE`. This gives the value in a merged cell to all cells within the merge range.

```{r, eval=F}
linelist_raw <- openxlsx::readWorkbook("linelist_raw.xlsx", fillMergedCells = TRUE)
```

<span style="color: red;">**_DANGER:_** If column names are merged, you will end up with duplicate column names, which you will need to fix manually - R does not work well with duplicate column names! You can re-name them by referencing their position (e.g. column 5), as explained in the section on manual column name cleaning..</span>


### Skip import of rows  

Sometimes, you may want to avoid importing a row of data (e.g. the column names, which are row 1).  
you can do this with the argument `skip = ` if using `import()` from the **rio** package on a .xlsx or .csv file. Provide the number of rows you want to skip.  



```{r, eval=F}
linelist_raw <- import("linelist_raw.xlsx", skip = 1)  # does not import header row
```

Unfortunately `skip = ` only accepts one integer value, *not* a range (e.g. "2:10"). To skip import of specific rows that are not consecutive from the top, consider importing multiple times and using `bind_rows()` from **dplyr**. See the example below of skipping only row 2.  





#### Removing a second header row  

Your data may have a *second* row of data, for example if it is a "data dictionary" row (see example below). 

```{r, echo=F}
# HIDDEN FROM READER
####################
# Create second header row of "data dictionary" and insert into row 2. Save as new dataframe.
linelist_2headers <- linelist %>%         
        mutate(across(everything(), as.character)) %>% 
        add_row(.before = 1,
                row_num = "000",
                case_id = "case identification number assigned by MOH",
                generation = "transmission chain generation number",
                date_infection = "estimated date of infection, mm/dd/yyyy",
                date_onset = "date of symptom onset, YYYY-MM-DD",
                date_hospitalisation = "date of initial hospitalization, mm/dd/yyyy",
                date_outcome = "date of outcome status determination",
                outcome = "either 'Death' or 'Recovered' or 'Unknown'",
                gender = "either 'm' or 'f' or 'unknown'",
                hospital = "Name of hospital of first admission",
                lon = "longitude of residence, approx",
                lat = "latitude of residence, approx",
                infector = "case_id of infector",
                source = "context of known transmission event",
                age = "age number",
                age_unit = "age unit, either 'years' or 'months' or 'days'",
                fever = "presence of fever on admission, either 'yes' or 'no'",
                chills = "presence of chills on admission, either 'yes' or 'no'",
                cough = "presence of cough on admission, either 'yes' or 'no'",
                aches = "presence of aches on admission, either 'yes' or 'no'",
                vomit = "presence of vomiting on admission, either 'yes' or 'no'",
                time_admission = "time of hospital admission HH:MM")
```


```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(head(linelist_2headers, 5), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 4, scrollX=T) )
```

This situation can be problematic because it can result in all columns being imported as class "character". To solve this, you will likely need to import the data twice.  

1) Import the data in order to store the correct column names  
2) Import the data again, skipping the first *two* rows (header and second rows)  
3) Bind the correct names onto the reduced dataframe

The exact arguments used to bind the correct column names depends on the type of data file (.csv, .tsv, .xlsx, etc.). If using **rio**'s `import()` function, understand which function **rio** uses to import your data, and then give the appropriate argument to skip lines and/or designate the column names. See the handbook page on importing data (LINK) for details on **rio**.  

**For Excel files:**  

```{r, eval=F}
# For excel files (remove 2nd row)
linelist_raw_names <- import("linelist_raw.xlsx") %>% names()  # save true column names

# import, skip row 2, assign to col_names =
linelist_raw <- import("linelist_raw.xlsx", skip = 2, col_names = linelist_raw_names) 
```

**For CSV files:**  

```{r, eval=F}
# For csv files
linelist_raw_names <- import("linelist_raw.csv") %>% names() # save true column names

# note argument is 'col.names ='
linelist_raw <- import("linelist_raw.csv", skip = 2, col.names = linelist_raw_names) 
```

**Backup option** - changing column names as a separate command

```{r, eval=F}
# assign/overwrite headers using the base 'colnames()' function
colnames(linelist_raw) <- linelist_raw_names
```

Bonus! If you do have a second row that is a data dictionary, you can easily create a proper data dictionary from it using the `gather()` command from the **tidyr** package.  
source: https://alison.rbind.io/post/2018-02-23-read-multiple-header-rows/

TO DO
```{r, eval=F}
library(tidyr)
stickers_dict <- import("linelist_raw.xlsx") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  gather(variable_name, variable_description)
stickers_dict
```


### Combine two header rows  

In some cases, you may want to combine two header rows into one. This command will define the column names as the combination (pasting together) of the existing column names with the value underneath in the first row. Replace "df" with the name of your dataset.  

```{r, eval=F}
names(df) <- paste(names(df), df[1, ], sep = "_")
```

## Select or re-order columns {.tabset .tabset-fade } 

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** This tab may follow from previous tabs.</span>


Often the first step of cleaning data is selecting the columns you want to work with, and to set their order in the dataframe. In a **dplyr** chain of verbs, this is done with `select()`. *Note that in these examples we modify linelist with select(), but do not assign/overwrite. We just display the resulting new column names, for purpose of example.*   

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** In the examples below, `linelist` is modified with `select()` but not over-written. New column names are only displayed for purpose of example.</span>


**Here are all the column names in the linelist:**

```{r}
names(linelist)
```

### Select & re-order


**Select only the columns you want to remain, *and their order of appearance***  

```{r}
# linelist dataset is piped through select() command, and names() prints just the column names
linelist %>% 
  select(case_id, date_onset, date_hospitalisation, fever) %>% 
  names() # display the column names
```
 

**Indicate which columns to remove** by placing a minus symbol "-" in front of the column name (e.g. `select(-outcome)`), or a vector of column names (as below). All other columns will be retained. Inside `select()` you can use normal operators such as `c()` to list several columns, `:` for consecutive columns, `!` for opposite, `&` for AND, and `|` for OR.  

```{r}
linelist %>% 
  select(-c(date_onset, fever:vomit)) %>% # remove onset and all symptom columns
  names()
```

**Re-order the columns** - use `everything()` to signify all other columns not specified in the `select()` command:  

```{r}
# move case_id, date_onset, date_hospitalisation, and gender to beginning
linelist %>% 
  select(case_id, date_onset, date_hospitalisation, gender, everything()) %>% 
  names()
```

As well as `everything()` there are several special functions that work *within* `select()`, namely:  

* `everything()`  - all other columns not mentioned  
* `last_col()`    - the last column  
* `where()`       - applies a function to all columns and selects those which are TRUE  
* `starts_with()` - matches to a specified prefix. Example: `select(starts_with("date"))`
* `ends_with()`   - matches to a specified suffix. Example: `select(ends_with("_end"))`  
* `contains()`    - columns containing a character string. Example: `select(contains("time"))` 
* `matches()`     - to apply a regular expression (regex). Example: `select(contains("[pt]al"))`  
* `num_range()`   - 
* `any_of()`      - matches if column is named. Useful if the name might not exist. Example: `select(any_of(date_onset, date_death, cardiac_arrest))`  

Here is an example using `where()`:  

```{r}
# select columns containing certain characters
linelist %>% 
  select(contains("date")) %>% 
  names()
```

```{r}
# searched for multiple character matches
linelist %>% 
  select(matches("onset|hosp|fev")) %>%   # note the OR symbol "|"
  names()
```



### `select()` as a stand-alone command

Select can also be used as an independent command (not in a pipe chain). In this case, the first argument is the original dataframe to be operated upon.  

```{r}
# Create a new linelist with id and age-related columns
linelist_age <- select(linelist, case_id, contains("age"))

# display the column names
names(linelist_age)
```



### Add to the pipe chain  

In the linelist, there are a few columns we do not need: `row_num`, `merged_header`, and `x28`. Remove them by adding a `select()` command to the cleaning pipe chain:  

```{r}
# CLEANING 'PIPE' CHAIN (starts with raw data and pipes it through cleaning steps)
##################################################################################

# begin cleaning pipe chain
###########################
linelist <- linelist_raw %>%
    
    # standardize column name syntax
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    
    # manually re-name columns
           # NEW name             # OLD name
    rename(date_infection       = infection_date,
           date_hospitalisation = hosp_date,
           date_outcome         = date_of_outcome) %>% 
    
    # remove column
    select(-c(row_num, merged_header, x28))
```






<!-- ======================================================= -->
<!-- ======================================================= -->
<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Modify class {.tabset .tabset-fade  #Classes}

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** This tab may follow from previous tabs.</span>

See section on [object classes](#objectclasses)   

Often you will need to set the correct class for a column. The most common approach is to use `mutate()` to define the column as itself, but with a different class.  Generally, this looks like this:  

```{r, eval=F}
# Examples of modifying class
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(date_var      = as.Date(date_var, format = "MM/DD/YYYY"),  # format should be the format of the raw data
         numeric_var   = as.numeric(numeric_var),
         character_var = as.character(character_var),
         factor_var    = factor(factor_var, levels = c(), labels = c())
         )
```

### Pre-checks and errors  

First we run some checks on the classes of important columns.  

The class of the "age" column is character. To perform analysis, we need those numbers to be recognized as numeric! 

```{r}
class(linelist$age)
```

The class of the "date_onset" column is also character! To perform analysis, these dates must be recognized as dates! 
 
```{r}
class(linelist$date_onset)
```

However, if we try to classify the `date_onset` column as date, we would get an error. Use `table()` or *sort* or another method to examine all the values and identify different one. For example in our dataset we see that we see that one `date_onset` value was entered in a different format (15th April 2014) than all the other values!    

```{r, echo=F}
head(table(linelist$date_onset))
```

Before we can classify "date_onset" as a date, this value must be fixed to be the same format as the others. You can fix the date in the source data, or, we can do in the cleaning pipeline via `mutate()` and `recode()`. This must be done *before* the commands to convert to class Date. (LINK TO DATE SECTION).  

```{r, eval=F}
# fix incorrect values                 # old value       # new value
mutate(date_onset = recode(date_onset, "15th April 2014" = "2014-04-15"))
```

The `mutate()` line can be read as: "mutate date_onset to equal date_onset recoded so that OLD VALUE is changed to NEW VALUE". Note that this pattern (OLD = NEW) for `recode()` is the opposite of most R patterns (new = old). The R development community is working on revising this for recoding.

Especially after converting to class date, check your data visually or with `table()` to confirm that they were converted correctly! For `as.Date()`, the `format = ` argument is often a source of errors. 


### Modify multiple columns  


You can use The **dplyr** function `across()` with `mutate()` to convert several columns at once to a new class. `across()` allows you to specify which columns you want a function to apply to. Below, we want to mutate the columns where `is.POSIXct()` (a type of date/time class that shows unnecessary timestamps) is `TRUE`, and apply the function `is.Date()` to them, in order to convert them to class "date".   

* Note that within `across()` we also use the function `where()`.  
* Note that is.POSIXct is from the package **lubridate**. Other similar functions (`is.character()`, `is.numeric()`, and `is.logical()`) are from **base R**  
* Note that the functions in `across()` are written *without* the empty parentheses ()  


```{r, eval=F}
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(across(where(lubridate::is.POSIXct), as.Date))
```


**Below, the described cleaning steps are added to the pipe chain.**  

```{r}
# CLEANING 'PIPE' CHAIN (starts with raw data and pipes it through cleaning steps)

# begin cleaning pipe chain

    rename(date_infection       = infection_date,
           date_hospitalisation = hosp_date,
           date_outcome         = date_of_outcome) %>% 
  
    # remove column
    select(-c(row_num, merged_header, x28)) %>%

    # correct the class of the columns
    mutate(across(contains("date"), as.Date), 
           generation = as.numeric(generation),
           age        = as.numeric(age)) 
```

## Add columns and rows {.tabset .tabset-fade } 

See the tabs below to add columns and rows



<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Add columns  {.tabset .tabset-fade }

#### `mutate()`  

We advise creating new columns with **dplyr** functions as part of a chain of such verb functions (e.g. filter, mutate, etc.)  
If in need of a stand-alone command, you can use `mutate()` or the **base** R style to create a new column (see below).  

**The verb `mutate()` is used to add a new column, or to modify an existing one.** Below is an example of creating a new columns with `mutate()`. The syntax is: **new_column_name = value or function**. 

```{r}
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(days_onset_hosp = as.numeric(date_hospitalisation - date_onset))
```

It is best practice to separate each new column with a comma and new line. Below, some practice columns are created:  

```{r}
linelist <- linelist %>%                       # creating new, or modifying old dataset
  mutate(new_var_dup    = case_id,             # new column = duplicate/copy another column
         new_var_static = 7,                   # new column = all values the same
         new_var_static = new_var_static + 5,  # you can overwrite a column, and it can be a calculation using other variables
         new_var_paste  = stringr::str_glue("{hospital} on ({date_hospitalisation})") # new column = pasting together values from other columns
         ) 
```

***Scroll to the right to see the new columns (first 50 rows):***  

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(head(linelist,50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T) )
```


<span style="color: darkgreen;">**_TIP:_** The verb `transmute()` adds new columns just like `mutate()` but also drops/removes all other columns that you do not mention.</span>

```{r, echo=F}
# HIDDEN FROM READER
# removes new demo columns created above
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  select(-contains("new_var"))
```


#### New columns using **base** R  


To define a new column (or re-define a column) using **base** R, just use the assignment operator as below.
Remember that when using **base** R you must specify the dataframe before writing the column name (e.g. `dataframe$column`). Here are two dummy examples:  

```{r, eval=F}
linelist$old_var <- linelist$old_var + 7
linelist$new_var <- linelist$old_var + linelist$age
```

<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Add rows  

TO DO

Remember that each column must contain values of only one class (either character, numeric, logical, etc.). So adding a row requires nuance to maintain this. 

```{r, eval=F}
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  add_row(row_num = 666, case_id = "abc", generation = 4, `infection date` = as.Date("2020-10-10"), .before = 2)
```

use .before and .after. .before = 3 will put it before the 3rd row. Default is to add it to the end. columns not specified will be let empty.
  The new row number may look strange ("...23") but the row numbers have changed. So if using the command twice examine/test carefully.

If your class is off you will see an error like this: Error: Can't combine `..1$infection date` <date> and `..2$infection date` <character>.
(for a date value remember to wrap the date in the function`as.Date()` like `as.Date("2020-10-10")`)






### New columns using grouped values

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** This tab may follow from previous tabs.</span>

Using mutate on GROUPED dataframes
https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html

Taken from website above:

```{r, eval=F}
#Because mutating expressions are computed within groups, they may yield different results on grouped tibbles. This will be the case as #soon as an aggregating, lagging, or ranking function is involved. Compare this ungrouped mutate:

starwars %>%
  select(name, mass, species) %>%
  mutate(mass_norm = mass / mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE))
With the grouped equivalent:

starwars %>%
  select(name, mass, species) %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  mutate(mass_norm = mass / mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE))
The former normalises mass by the global average whereas the latter normalises by the averages within species levels.

## Recoding values {.tabset .tabset-fade  #recode}

For example, in `linelist` the values in the column "hospital" must be cleaned. There are several different spellings (often the word "Hospital" is missing an "s" and is written "Hopital"), and many missing values.

```{r}
table(linelist$hospital, useNA = "always")
```


<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Manual recoding {.tabset .tabset-fade }

These tabs demonstrate re-coding values manually b providing specific spellings to be corrected:  

* Using `replace()` for specific rows  
* Using `recode()` for entire columns  
* Using **base** R  


#### `replace()`  

To manually change values for specific rows within a dataframe (from within a pipe chain), use `replace()` within `mutate()`.  
Use a logic condition to specify rows, for example an ID value of one row. The general syntax is:  

`mutate(col_to_change = replace(col_to_change, criteria for rows, new value))`.  

In the first example below, the gender value, in the row where id is "2195", is changed to "Female".  

```{r, eval=F}
# Example: change gender of one specific observation to "Female" 
mutate(gender = replace(gender, id == "2195", "Female")

# Example: chance gender of one specific observation to NA 
mutate(gender = replace(gender, id == "2195", NA)
```


#### `recode()`  

To change spellings manually, one-by-one, you can use the `recode()` function *within the `mutate()` function. The code is saying that the column "hospital" should be defined as the current column "hospital", but with certain changes (the syntax is OLD = NEW). **Don't forget commas!**  

```{r}
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(hospital = recode(hospital,
                      # OLD = NEW
                      "Mitylira Hopital"  = "Military Hospital",
                      "Mitylira Hospital" = "Military Hospital",
                      "Military Hopital"  = "Military Hospital",
                      "Port Hopital"      = "Port Hospital",
                      "Central Hopital"   = "Central Hospital",
                      "other"             = "Other",
                      "St. Marks Maternity Hopital (SMMH)" = "St. Mark's Maternity Hospital (SMMH)"
                      ))
```

Now we see the values in the `hospital` column have been corrected:  

```{r}
table(linelist$hospital, useNA = "always")
```

<span style="color: darkgreen;">**_TIP:_** The number of spaces before and after an equals sign does not matter. Make your code easier to read by aligning the = for all or most rows. Also, consider adding a hashed comment row to clarify for future readers which side is OLD and which side is NEW. </span>  

<span style="color: darkgreen;">**_TIP:_** Sometimes a *blank* character value exists in a dataset (not recognized as R's value for missing - `NA`). You can reference this value with two quotation marks with no space inbetween ("").</span>  


#### **base** R  


If necessary, you make manual changes to a specific value in a dataframe by referencing the row number of case ID. But remember it is better if you can make these changes permanently in the underlying data! 

Here is a fake example. It reads as "Change the value of the dataframe `linelist`'s column `onset_date` (for the row where `linelist`'s column `case_id` has the value  '9d4019') to `as.Date("2020-10-24")`".   

```{r, eval=F}
linelist$date_onset[linelist$case_id == "9d4019"] <- as.Date("2020-10-24")
```


<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Recoding by logic {.tabset .tabset-fade}

These tabs demonstrate re-coding values in a column using logic and conditions:  

* Using `case_when()`  
* Using `ifelse()` and `if_else()`  
* Using special **dplyr** recoding functions like:  
  * `replace_na()`  
  * `na_if()`  
  * `coalesnce()`  


#### `case_when()`  


If you need to use logic statements to recode values, or want to use operators like `%in%`, use **dplyr**'s `case_when()` instead. **If you use `case_when()` please read the thorough explanation HERE LINK, as there are important differences from `recode()` in syntax and logic order!**   

Note that all Right-hand side (RHS) inputs must be of the same class (e.g. character, numeric, logical). Notice the use of the special value `NA_real_` instead of just `NA`.  

```{r}
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(age_years = case_when(
            age_unit == "years"  ~ age,       # if age is given in years
            age_unit == "months" ~ age/12,    # if age is given in months
            is.na(age_unit)      ~ age,       # if age unit is missing, assume years
            TRUE                 ~ NA_real_)) # Any other circumstance
```



#### `ifelse()` and `if_else()`  

For simple uses of logical re-coding or new variable creationgyou can use `ifelse()` or `if_else()`. Though in most cases it is better to use `case_when()`.  

These commands are simplified versions of an `if` and `else` statement. The general syntax is ifelse(**condition**, **value if condition evaluates to TRUE**, **value if condition evaluates to FALSE**). If used in a `mutate()`, each row is evaluated. `if_else()` is a special version from **dplyr** that handles dates in the condition.

It can be tempting to string together many ifelse commands... resist this and **use `case_when()` instead!** It is much more simple, easier to read, and easier to identify errors.  

IMAGE of ifelse string with X across is. 



You can reference other columns with the `ifelse()` function within `mutate()`:  

Example of `ifelse()`:  

```{r, eval=F}
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(source_known = ifelse(!is.na(source), "known", "unknown"))
```

Example of `if_else()` (using dates):
Note that if the 'true' value is a date, the 'false' value must also qualify a date, hence using the special character `NA_real_` instead of just `NA`.

```{r, eval=F}
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(date_death = if_else(outcome == "Death", date_outcome, NA_real_))
```

Note: If you want to alternate a value used in your code based on other circumstances, consider using `switch()` from **base** R. For example if... TO DO. See the section on using `switch()` in the page on R interactive console.


<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Recoding using special **dplyr** functions  


#### Using `replace_na()`  

To change missing values (`NA`) to a specific character value, such as "Missing", use the function `replace_na()` within `mutate()`. Note that this is used in the same manner as `recode` above - the name of the variable must be repeated within `replace_na()`.  

```{r}
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(hospital = replace_na(hospital, "Missing"))
```


#### Using `na_if()`  

Likewise you can quickly convert a specific character value to `NA` using `na_if()`. The command below is the opposite of the one above. It converts any values of "Missing" to `NA`.

```{r}
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(hospital = na_if(hospital, "Missing"))
```

#### Using `coalesce()`  

This **dplyr** function finds the first non-missing value at each position. So, you provide it with columns and for each row it will fill the value with the first non-missing value in the columns you provided.  

For example, you might use `this`coalesce()` create a "location" variable from hypothetical variables "patient_residence" and "reporting_jurisdiction", where you prioritize patient residence information, if it exists.  

```{r, eval=F}
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(location = coalesce(patient_residence, reporting_jurisdiction))
```

lead(), lag()
cumsum(), cummean(), cummin(), cummax(), cumany(), cumall(),  


<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Recoding using cleaning dictionaries

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** This tab may follow from previous tabs.</span>

```{r, eval=F}
## load cleaning rules and only keep columns in mll
mll_cleaning_rules <- import(here("dictionaries/mll_cleaning_rules.xlsx")) %>%
  filter(column %in% c(names(mll_raw), ".global"))

## define columns that are not cleand
unchanged <- c(
  "epilink_relationship",
  "narratives",
  "epilink_relationship_detail"
)

mll_clean <- mll_raw %>%
  ## convert to tibble
  as_tibble() %>%
  ## clean columns using cleaning rules
  clean_data(
    wordlists = mll_cleaning_rules,
    protect = names(.) %in% unchanged
  )

```

## Filter rows {.tabset .tabset-fade }

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** This tab may follow from previous tabs.</span>

A typical early cleaning step is to filter the dataframe for specific rows using the **dplyr** verb `filter()`. Within `filter()`, give the logic that must be `TRUE` for a row in the dataset to be kept. 

The tabs below show how to filter rows based on simple and complex logical conditions, and how to filter/subset rows as a stand-alone command and with **base** R

<!-- ======================================================= -->
### A simple `filter()`  

This simple example re-defines the dataframe `linelist` as itself, having filtered the rows to meet a logical condition. **Only the rows where the logical statement within the parentheses is `TRUE` are kept.**  

In this case, the logical statement is `!is.na(case_id)`, which is asking whether the value in the column `case_id` is **not** missing (`NA`). Thus, rows where `case_id` is **not** missing are kept.  

Before the filter is applied, the number of rows in `linelist` is `r nrow(linelist)`.

```{r}
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  filter(!is.na(case_id))  # keep only rows where case_id is not missing
```

After the filter is applied, the number of rows in `linelist` is `r nrow(linelist)`. 



<!-- ======================================================= -->
### A complex `filter()` 

A more complex example using `filter()`:  

#### Examine the data  

Below is a simple one-line command to create a histogram of onset dates. See that a second smaller outbreak from 2012-2013 is also included in this dataset. **For our analyses, we want to remove entries from this earlier outbreak.**  

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
hist(linelist$date_onset, breaks = 50)
```


#### How filters handle missing numeric and date values  

Can we just filter by `date_onset` to rows after June 2013? **Caution! Applying the code `filter(date_onset > as.Date("2013-06-01")))` would accidentally remove any rows in the later epidemic with a missing date of onset!**  

<span style="color: red;">**_DANGER:_** Filtering to greater than (>) or less than (<) a date or number can remove any rows with missing values (`NA`)! This is because `NA` is treated as infinitely large and small.</span>


#### Design the filter  

Examine a cross-tabulation to make sure we exclude only the correct rows:  

```{r}
table(Hospital  = linelist$hospital,                     # hospital name
      YearOnset = lubridate::year(linelist$date_onset),  # year of date_onset
      useNA     = "always")                              # show missing values
```

What other criteria can we filter on to remove the first outbreak from the dataset? We see that:  

* The first epidemic occurred at Hospital A, Hospital B, and that there were also 10 cases at Port Hospital.  
* Hospitals A & B did *not* have cases in the second epidemic, but Port Hospital did.  

We want to exclude:  

* The `r nrow(linelist %>% filter(hospital %in% c("Hospital A", "Hospital B") | date_onset < as.Date("2013-06-01")))` rows with onset in 2012 and 2013 at either hospital A, B, or Port:  
  * Exclude the `r nrow(linelist %>% filter(date_onset < as.Date("2013-06-01")))` rows with onset in 2012 and 2013
  * Exclude the `r nrow(linelist %>% filter(hospital %in% c('Hospital A', 'Hospital B') & is.na(date_onset)))` rows from Hospitals A & B with missing onset dates  
  * Do **not** exclude the `r nrow(linelist %>% filter(!hospital %in% c('Hospital A', 'Hospital B') & is.na(date_onset)))` other rows with missing onset dates.  

We start with a linelist of `nrow(linelist)`. Here is our filter statement:  

```{r}
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  # keep rows where onset is after 1 June 2013 OR where onset is missing and it was a hospital OTHER than Hospital A or B
  filter(date_onset > as.Date("2013-06-01") | (is.na(date_onset) & !hospital %in% c("Hospital A", "Hospital B")))

nrow(linelist)
```

When we re-make the cross-tabulation, we see that Hospitals A & B are removed completely, and the 10 Port Hospital cases from 2012 & 2013 are removed, and all other values are the same - just as we wanted.  
 
```{r}
table(Hospital  = linelist$hospital,                     # hospital name
      YearOnset = lubridate::year(linelist$date_onset),  # year of date_onset
      useNA     = "always")                              # show missing values
```

Multiple statements can be included within one filter command (separated by commas), or you can always pipe to a separate filter() command for clarity.  


*Note: some readers may notice that it would be easier to just filter by `date_hospitalisation` because it is 100% complete with no missing values. This is true. But `date_onset` is used for purposes of demonstrating a complex filter.* 


### Filter as a stand-alone command  
<h3> Filter as a stand-alone command </h3>

Filtering can also be done as a stand-alone command (not part of a pipe chain). Like other **dplyr** verbs, in this case the first argument must be the dataset itself.  

```{r, eval=F}
# dataframe <- filter(dataframe, condition(s) for rows to keep)

linelist <- filter(linelist, !is.na(case_id))
```

You can also use **base** R to subset using square brackets which reflect the [rows, columns] that you want to retain.  

```{r, eval=F}
# dataframe <- dataframe[row conditions, column conditions] (blank means keep all)

linelist <- linelist[!is.na(case_id), ]
```

<span style="color: darkgreen;">**_TIP:_** Use bracket-subset syntax with `View()` to quickly review a few records.</span>




### Filtering to quickly review data  

This **base** R syntax can be handy when you want to quickly view a subset of rows and columns. Use the **base** R `View()` command (note the capital "V") around the [] subset you want to see. The result will appear as a dataframe in your RStudio viewer panel. For example, if I want to review onset and hospitalization dates of 3 specific cases:  

View the linelist in the viewer panel:  

```{r, eval=F}
View(linelist)
```

View specific data for three cases:  

```{r, eval=F}
View(linelist[linelist$case_id %in% c("11f8ea", "76b97a", "47a5f5"), c("date_onset", "date_hospitalisation")])
```

Note: the above command can also be written with **dplyr** verbs `filter()` and `select()` as below:  

```{r, eval=F}
View(linelist %>%
       filter(case_id %in% c("11f8ea", "76b97a", "47a5f5")) %>%
       select(date_onset, date_hospitalisation))
```

## Numeric categories {#num_cats .tabset .tabset-fade}

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** This tab may follow from previous tabs.</span>

Special approaches for creating numeric categories  

Common examples include age categories, groups of lab values, etc.  

There are several ways to create categories of a numeric column such as age. Here we will discuss:  

* `age_categories()`, from the **epikit** package  
* `cut()`, from **base** R  
* using percentiles to break your numbers  
* natural break points... ? TO DO  
* case_when()


Sometimes, numeric variables will import as class "character". This occurs if there are non-numeric characters in some of the values, for example an entry of "2 months" for age, or (depending on your R locale settings) if a comma is used in the decimals place (e.g. "4,5" to mean four and one half years).  

For this example we will create an `age_cat` column using the `age_years` column.  

```{r}
#check the class of the linelist variable age
class(linelist$age_years)

```


<!-- ======================================================= -->
### `age_categories()`**

With the **epikit** package, you can use the `age_categories()` function to easily categorize and label numeric columns (note: this can be applied to non-age numeric variables too). The output is an ordered factor.

The break values specified are included in the higher group, that is groups are open on the lower/left side. As shown below, you can add 1 to each break value to achieve groups that are open at the top/right.

Other *optional* arguments:  

* `lower = ` Default is 0). The lowest number you want considered.  
* `upper = ` The highest number you want considered.  
* `by = `    The number of years between groups.  
* `separator = ` Default is "-". Character between ages in labels.  
* `ceiling = ` Default FALSE. If TRUE, the highest break value is a ceiling and a category "XX+" is not included. Any values above highest break or `upper` (if defined) are categorized as `NA`.  

See the function's Help page for more details (enter `?age_categories` in the R console).

### `cut()` {#cut .tabset .tabset-fade}

You can use the **base** R function `cut()`, which creates categories from a numeric variable. The differences from `age_categories()` are:  

* You do not need to install/load another package  
* You can specify whether groups are open/closed on the right/left  
* You must provide labels yourself (and ensure they are accurate to the groups)  
* If you want 0 included in the lowest group you must specify this  

The basic syntax within `cut()` is to first provide the numeric variable to be cut (age_years), and then the *breaks* argument, which is a numeric vector (`c()`) of break points. Using `cut()`, the resulting column is an ordered factor.

If used within `mutate()` (a **dplyr** verb) it is not necessary to specify the dataframe before the column name (e.g. `linelist$age_years`).


#### Simple `cut()` example  

Create new column of age categories (`age_cat`) by cutting the numeric `age_year` column at specified break points. The example below replicates the first `age_categories()` example.  

* Specify numeric vector of break points `c(0, 5, 10, 15, ...)`  
* Default behavior for `cut()` is that lower break values are *excluded* from each category, and upper break values are *included*. This is the opposite behavior from the `age_categories()` function.  
* Include 0 in the lowest category by adding `include.lowest = TRUE`  
* Add a vector of customized labels using the `labels = ` argument  
* Check your work with cross-tabulation of the numeric and category columns - be aware of missing values  


```{r}
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(age_cat = cut(age_years,                                       # numeric column
                        breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 70,        # break points...
                                   max(linelist$age_years, na.rm=T)),   # ... with dynamic last break as column max value
                        right = TRUE,                                   # lower breaks included and upper excluded [a,b)
                        include.lowest = TRUE,                          # 0 included in lowest category
                        labels = c("0-4", "5-9", "10-14", "15-19",      # manual labels - be careful!
                                   "20-29", "30-49", "50-69", "70+")))       

table(linelist$age_cat, useNA = "always")
```



#### `cut()` details  


Below is a detailed description of the behavior of using `cut()` to make the `age_cat` column. Key points:    

* Inclusion/exclusion behavior of break points  
* Custom category labels  
* Handling missing values  
* **Check your work!**  

The most simple command of `cut()` applied to `age_years` to make the new variable `age_cat` is below:  

```{r}
# Create new variable, by cutting the numeric age variable
# by default, upper break is excluded and lower break excluded from each category
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(age_cat = cut(age_years, breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 70, 100)))

# tabulate the number of observations per group
table(linelist$age_cat, useNA = "always")

```

* **By default**, the categorization occurs so that the right/upper side is "open" and inclusive (and the left/lower side is "closed" or exclusive). The default labels use the notation "(A, B]", which means the group does not include A (the lower break value), but includes B (the upper break value). **Reverse this behavior by providing the `right = TRUE` argument**.  

* Thus, **by default** "0" values are excluded from the lowest group, and categorized as `NA`. "0" values could be infants coded as age 0. To change this **add the argument `include.lowest = TRUE`**. Then, any "0" values are included in the lowest group. The automatically-generated label for the lowest category will change from "(0,B]" to "[0,B]", which signifies that 0 values are included.  

* **Check your work!!!** Verify that each age value was assigned to the correct category by cross-tabulating the numeric and category columns. Examine assignment of boundary values (e.g. 15, if neighboring categories are 10-15 and 15-20).  

```{r class.source = 'fold-hide'}
# Cross tabulation of the numeric and category columns. 
table("Numeric Values" = linelist$age_years,   # names specified in table for clarity.
      "Categories"     = linelist$age_cat,
      useNA = "always")                        # don't forget to examine NA values
```

Read more about `cut()` in its Help page by entering `?cut` in the R console.  



**Reversing break inclusion behavior in `cut()`**  

Lower break values will be included in each category (and upper break values excluded) if the argument `right = ` is included and and set to `TRUE`. This is applied below - note how the values have shifted among the categories.  

<span style="color: black;">**_NOTE:_** If you include the `include.lowest = TRUE` argument **and** `right = TRUE`, the `include.lowest` will now apply to the *highest* break point value and category, not the lowest.</span>  

```{r class.source = 'fold-show'}
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(age_cat = cut(age_years,
                          breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 70, 100),     # same breaks
                          right = FALSE,                                     # include each *lower* break point            
                          labels = c("0-4", "5-9", "10-14", "15-19",
                                     "20-29", "30-49", "50-69", "70-100")))  # now the labels must change

table(linelist$age_cat, useNA = "always")

```


**Re-labeling `NA` values with `cut()`**

Because `cut()` does not automatically label `NA` values, you may want to assign a label such as "Missing". This requires a few extra steps because `cut()` automatically classified the new column `age_cat` as a Factor (a rigid column class with specific value labels). 

First, convert `age_cut` from Factor to Character class, so you have flexibility to add new character values (e.g. "Missing"). Otherwise you will encounter an error. Then, use the **dplyr** verb `replace_na()` to replace `NA` values with a character value like "Missing". These steps can be combined into one step, as shown below.  

Note that Missing has been added, **but the order of the categories is now wrong (alphabetical).**  

```{r}
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  
  # cut() creates age_cat, automatically of class Factor      
  mutate(age_cat = cut(age_years,
                          breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 70, 100),          
                          right = FALSE,                                                      
                          labels = c("0-4", "5-9", "10-14", "15-19",
                                     "20-29", "30-49", "50-69", "70-100")),
         
         # convert to class Character, and replace NA with "Missing"
         age_cat = replace_na(as.character(age_cat), "Missing"))


table(linelist$age_cat, useNA = "always")
```

To fix this, re-convert `age_cat` to a factor, and define the order of the levels correctly.

```{r}
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  
  # cut() creates age_cat, automatically of class Factor      
  mutate(age_cat = cut(age_years,
                          breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 70, 100),          
                          right = FALSE,                                                      
                          labels = c("0-4", "5-9", "10-14", "15-19",
                                     "20-29", "30-49", "50-69", "70-100")),
         
         # convert to class Character, and replace NA with "Missing"
         age_cat = replace_na(as.character(age_cat), "Missing"),
         
         # re-classify age_cat as Factor, with correct level order and new "Missing" level
         age_cat = factor(age_cat, levels = c("0-4", "5-9", "10-14", "15-19", "20-29",
                                              "30-49", "50-69", "70-100", "Missing")))    
  

table(linelist$age_cat, useNA = "always")

```


If you want a fast way to make breaks and labels, you can use something like below (adjust to your specific situation). See the page on using seq() and rep() and c() TO DO

```{r, eval=F}
# Make break points from 0 to 90 by 5
age_seq = seq(from = 0, to = 90, by = 5)
age_seq

# Make labels for the above categories, assuming default cut() settings
age_labels = paste0(age_seq+1, "-", age_seq + 5)
age_labels

# check that both vectors are the same length
length(age_seq) == length(age_labels)

# # Use them in the cut() command
# cut(linelist$age, breaks = age_seq, labels = age_labels)
```


<!-- ======================================================= -->
### `case_when()`

The dplyr function `case_when()` can also be used to create numeric categories.  

* Allows explicit setting of break point inclusion/exclusion  
* Allows designation of label for `NA` values in one step  
* More complicated code, *arguably* more prone to error  
* Allow more flexibility to include other variables in the logic  

**If using `case_when()` please review the in-depth page on it, as the logic and order of assignment are important understand to avoid errors.**

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** In `case_when()` all right-hand side values must be of the same class. Thus, if your categories are character values (e.g. "20-30 years") then any designated outcome for `NA` age values must also be character ("Missing", or the special `NA_character_` instead of `NA`).</span>

You will need to designate the column as a factor (by wrapping `case_when()` in the function `factor()`) and provide the ordering of the factor levels using the `levels = ` argument *after* the close of the `case_when()` function. When using `cut()`, the factor and ordering of levels is done automatically.  


```{r}
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(age_cat = factor(case_when(
          # provide the case_when logic and outcomes
          age_years >= 0 & age_years < 5     ~ "0-4",          # logic by age_year value
          age_years >= 5 & age_years < 10    ~ "5-9",
          age_years >= 10 & age_years < 15   ~ "10-14",
          age_years >= 15 & age_years < 20   ~ "15-19",
          age_years >= 20 & age_years < 30   ~ "20-29",
          age_years >= 30 & age_years < 50   ~ "30-49",
          age_years >= 50 & age_years < 70   ~ "50-69",
          age_years >= 45 & age_years <= 100 ~ "70-100",
          is.na(age_years)                   ~ "Missing",  # if age_years is missing
          TRUE                               ~ "Check value"   # catch-all alarm to trigger review
          ), levels = c("0-4","5-9", "10-14", "15-19", "20-29", "30-49", "50-69", "70-100", "Missing", "Check value"))
         )

```

## Transforming multiple variables at once

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** This tab may follow from previous tabs.</span>


A transformation can be applied to multiple variables at once using the `across()` function from the package **dplyr** (contained within **tidyverse** package).  

`across()` can be used with any **dplyr** verb, but commonly with as `mutate()`, `filter()`, or `summarise()`. Here are some examples to get started. 


Example of how one would change all columns to character class  

```{r, eval=F}
#to change all columns to character class
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(across(everything(), as.character))
```

Change only numeric columns

Here are a few online resources on using `across()`: [Hadley Wickham's thoughts/rationale](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/dplyr-1-0-0-colwise/)

## Deduplication

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** This tab may follow from previous tabs.</span>

See the handbook page on deduplications (LINK), just one aspect of which is addressed here.  

The package **dplyr** offers the `distinct()` function to reduce the dataframe to only unique rows - removing duplicates.  
In this case we just want to remove rows that are complete duplicates, so we just add the simple command `distinct()`.  

We begin with `r nrow(linelist)` rows in `linelist`. 

```{r}
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  distinct()
```

After deduplication there are `r nrow(linelist)` rows. 



Below, the `distinct()` command is added to the cleaning pipe chain:  

```{r}
