# Contact tracing { }

THIS PAGE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION

This page walks through some key considerations when analyzing and visualizing contact tracing data. Many core R competencies and tools are covered in other sections as the same desired functionalities apply (i.e. data cleaning; pivoting; tables; epi-curves) but we will highlight key examples specific to contact tracing that have been useful for operational decision making (i.e. visualizing contact tracing follow-up data over time or across geographic areas).

For demonstration purposes we will be reading in sample contact tracing data from the [Go.Data](https://www.who.int/tools/godata) platform; although the same principles could apply for other structured contact tracing data. You can read more about the Go.Data project on the [Github Documentation site](https://worldhealthorganization.github.io/godata/) or [Community of Practice](https://community-godata.who.int/).

## Preparation

This code chunk shows the loading of packages required for the analyses. In this handbook we emphasize `p_load()` from **pacman**, which installs the package if necessary *and* loads it for use. You can also load installed packages with  `library()` from **base** R. See the page on [R basics] for more information on R packages.  

```{r, message = F}
pacman::p_load(
  rio,        # importing data  
  here,       # relative file pathways  
  janitor,    # data cleaning and tables
  lubridate,  # working with dates
  epikit,     # age_categories() function
  apyramid,   # age pyramids
  tidyverse,  # data manipulation and visualization
  RColorBrewer # color palettes
)
```


### Import data {-}

We will import the sample datasets of contacts and contact followups that have been retrieved and un-nested from the Go.Data API and stored as .rds output files.

```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "godata_api_github.png"))
```

If you want to download the data to follow step-by-step, see instructions in the [Download handbook and data] page. The dataset is imported using the `import()` function from the **rio** package. See the page on [Import and export] for various ways to import data. For the full steps on how to retrieve data collections from your Go.Data instance, view the Github documentation [here](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/godata/tree/master/analytics/r-reporting)

Below we import the .rds files, located in the 'godata' sub-folder within the 'data' folder.  

```{r, echo=F}
# import the data collections
cases <- rio::import(here::here("data", "godata", "cases_clean.rds"))
contacts <- rio::import(here::here("data", "godata", "contacts_clean.rds"))
followups <- rio::import(here::here("data", "godata", "followups_clean.rds"))
relationships <- rio::import(here::here("data", "godata", "relationships_clean.rds"))
```

Let's start with the contact linelist - the first 50 rows of the registered linelist are displayed below.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the first 50 rows of contact linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(head(contacts, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

### Basic Demographics {-}

Following instructions from previous pages, we can view some basic tables and plots of case and contact demographics. For instance, we can see age/sex breakdown (using *apyramid* package described earlier)

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
contact_unknown_age <- sum(contacts$age_class == "unknown") # count unknown

contact_age_pyramid <-
apyramid::age_pyramid(data = contacts,
                      age_group = "age_class",
                      split_by = "gender") +
       labs(
       fill = "Gender",
       title = "Age/Sex Pyramid of COVID-19 contacts",
       subtitle = paste0("n = ", contact_unknown_age," without age recorded,")) +
     theme_minimal() # cleaner theme

contact_age_pyramid

```

We can also view other demographics such as occupational breakdown of registered contacts (in form of a pie chart).

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
contacts$occupation <- as.factor(contacts$occupation) # ensure occupation is a factor
contact_unknown_occupation <- sum(is.na(contacts$occupation) | contacts$occupation == "UNKNOWN") # count unknown
getPalette = colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(9, "Set1"))
color_count = length(unique(contacts$occupation)) # for color palette

contact_occupation_breakdown <- contacts %>%
  group_by(occupation) %>%
  count() 

contact_occupation_pie_chart <-
  ggplot(subset(contact_occupation_breakdown, !is.na(occupation)), aes(x = "", y = n, fill = occupation)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = getPalette(color_count)) +
  labs(
       fill = "Occupation",
       title = "Occupational breakdown of COVID-19 contacts",
       subtitle = paste0("n = ", contact_unknown_occupation," without occupation recorded,")
       ) +
  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank())

contact_occupation_pie_chart

```

#### Contact Follow Up Data {-}

We can also view the longitudinal follow-up data by summarizing it for a given contact or looking at the discrete follow up events over time. This could be viewed by contact tracer, supervision team and geographic area; and also by day and week.

A sample follow-up list could look like this, with one row for each follow-up generated.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# display the first 50 rows of contact linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(head(followups, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```
For each follow-up, we have a follow-up STATUS (such as whether it was performed and if so, did they have symptoms or not). We can group by `followup_status` to see the frequency of each:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}

followup_status <- followups %>%
     group_by(followup_status) %>%
     count()

followup_status

```


#### KPI Tables {-}

```{r, warning=F, message=F}

```

#### Transmission Matrices {-}

As discussed in the [Heat plots] page, you can view a matrix of "who infected whom".

When new contacts are created, Go.Data stores this relationship information in the "relationships" API endpoint; and we can see the dataset below. This means that we can create a heatmap with relatively few steps given each contact is already joined to it's source case.

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# display the first 50 rows of relationships data as a table
DT::datatable(head(relationships, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

We can grab the few variables we need and add age-categories for sources (cases) and targets (contacts).


```{r}
heatmap_ages <- relationships %>% 
  filter(!is.na(source_visualid) & !is.na(target_visualid)) %>%
  select(source_visualid, source_age, target_visualid, target_age) %>% 
  # WHO recommended age categories, updated Sept 2020
  mutate(
    source_age_class = factor(
      case_when(
        source_age <= 4 ~ "0-4",
        source_age <= 9 ~ "5-9",
        source_age <= 14 ~ "10-14",
        source_age <= 19 ~ "15-19",
        source_age <= 29 ~ "20-29",
        source_age <= 39 ~ "30-39",
        source_age <= 49 ~ "40-49",
        source_age <= 59 ~ "50-59",
        source_age <= 64 ~ "60-64",
        source_age <= 69 ~ "65-69",
        source_age <= 74 ~ "70-74",
        source_age <= 79 ~ "75-79",
        is.finite(source_age) ~ "80+",
        TRUE ~ "unknown"
      ), levels = c(
        "0-4",
        "5-9",
        "10-14",
        "15-19",
        "20-29",
        "30-39",
        "40-49",
        "50-59",
        "60-64",
        "65-69",
        "70-74",
        "75-79",
        "80+",
        "unknown"
      )),
    source_age_class = factor(
      source_age_class,
      levels = rev(levels(source_age_class)))) %>%
     
     mutate(
    target_age_class = factor(
      case_when(
        target_age <= 4 ~ "0-4",
        target_age <= 9 ~ "5-9",
        target_age <= 14 ~ "10-14",
        target_age <= 19 ~ "15-19",
        target_age <= 29 ~ "20-29",
        target_age <= 39 ~ "30-39",
        target_age <= 49 ~ "40-49",
        target_age <= 59 ~ "50-59",
        target_age <= 64 ~ "60-64",
        target_age <= 69 ~ "65-69",
        target_age <= 74 ~ "70-74",
        target_age <= 79 ~ "75-79",
        is.finite(target_age) ~ "80+",
        TRUE ~ "unknown"
      ), levels = c(
        "0-4",
        "5-9",
        "10-14",
        "15-19",
        "20-29",
        "30-39",
        "40-49",
        "50-59",
        "60-64",
        "65-69",
        "70-74",
        "75-79",
        "80+",
        "unknown"
      )),
    target_age_class = factor(
      target_age_class,
      levels = rev(levels(target_age_class))))

```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the shapefile as a table
DT::datatable(head(heatmap_ages, 50), rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

As described previously, we create cross-tabulation; 

```{r, warning=F, message=FALSE}

cross_tab <- 
      table(source_cases = heatmap_ages$source_age_class,
      target_cases = heatmap_ages$target_age_class)

```

convert into long format with proportions;

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

long_prop <- data.frame(prop.table(cross_tab))

```

and create a heat-map.


```{r, warning=F, message=F}

ggplot(data = long_prop)+       # use long data, with proportions as Freq
  geom_tile(                    # visualize it in tiles
    aes(
      x = target_cases,         # x-axis is case age
      y = source_cases,     # y-axis is infector age
      fill = Freq))+            # color of the tile is the Freq column in the data
  scale_fill_gradient(          # adjust the fill color of the tiles
    low = "blue",
    high = "orange")+
  labs(                         # labels
    x = "Target case age",
    y = "Source case age",
    title = "Who infected whom - Go.Data Relationships Linelist",
    subtitle = "Frequency matrix of transmission events",
    fill = "Proportion of all\ntranmsission events"     # legend title
  )

```
