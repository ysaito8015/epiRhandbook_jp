THIS PAGE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Hi Sara, some notes for you:


include static images or GIFs like this:

```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "flexdashboard_output.png"))
```

Write package names with bold **dplyr** **tidyverse** **rio**

Write functions in code text with open parentheses `filter()`, `import()` `ggplot()`. Write arguments also in code text with equals sign `size = `, `data =`, `color = `, etc.

Link to other pages by exact name in brackets like the [Import and export] page. Or give them a custom link text like this, with brackets following brackets:   See [the importing page][Import and export]  

Link to a website [secondary attack rate](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774102)

Be explicit about which functions belong to which packages (either noting in the text, or using `::`)
Use `pacman::p_load()`

No need to give chunk labels

Please place {-} after any heading level-3 or more (###) so the numbers don't appear in the TOC


Please include a preparation section like below. You can display interactive data frames/tibbles with DT as shown below.

If you want to preview the page, you can just press Knit. Or use the combination of bookdown_runfile.R and bookdown_small.yml in the root folder to see website layout. Ping me with questions.  




## Preparation

### Load packages {-}  

In this handbook we emphasize `p_load()` from **pacman**, which installs the package if necessary *and* loads it for use. You can also load installed packages with  `library()` from **base** R. See the page on [R basics] for more information on R packages.  

```{r}
pacman::p_load(
  rio,             # data import/export     
  here,            # locate files
  tidyverse        # data management and visualization
)
```

### Import data {-}

We import the dataset of cases from a simulated Ebola epidemic. If you want to download the data to follow step-by-step, see instructions in the [Download handbook and data] page. The dataset is imported using the `import()` function from the **rio** package. See the page on [Import and export] for various ways to import data.

```{r, echo=F}
# import the linelist into R
linelist <- rio::import(here::here("data", "case_linelists", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))
```

```{r, eval=F}
# import the linelist
linelist <- import("linelist_cleaned.xlsx")
```

The first 50 rows of the linelist are displayed below.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the first 50 rows of linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(head(linelist, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```
