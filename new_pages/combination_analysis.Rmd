# Combination analysis { }  

<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Overview {  }


This analysis plots the frequency of different **combinations** of values/responses. In this example, we plot the frequency of symptom combinations.  

This analysis is often called:  
**Multiple response analysis**
**Sets analysis**
**Combinations analysis**

The first method shown uses the package **ggupset**, an the second using the package **UpSetR**. 

```
An example plot is below. Five symptoms are shown. Below each vertical bar is a line and dots indicating the combination of symptoms reflected by the bar above. To the right, horizontal bars reflect the frequency of each individual symptom.
```

```{r echo=F, out.width= "75%"}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse,
               UpSetR,
               ggupset)

# Adds new symptom variables to the linelist, with random "yes" or "no" values 
linelist_sym <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(fever  = sample(c("yes", "no"), nrow(linelist), replace = T, prob = c(0.80, 0.20)),
         chills = sample(c("yes", "no"), nrow(linelist), replace = T, prob = c(0.20, 0.80)),
         cough  = sample(c("yes", "no"), nrow(linelist), replace = T, prob = c(0.9, 0.15)),
         aches  = sample(c("yes", "no"), nrow(linelist), replace = T, prob = c(0.10, 0.90)),
         shortness_of_breath = sample(c("yes", "no"), nrow(linelist), replace = T))

# produced the plot (just for show)
linelist_sym_2 <- linelist_sym %>% 
  mutate(fever = case_when(fever == "yes" ~ 1,          # if old value is "yes", new value is "fever"
                           TRUE           ~ 0),   # if old value is anything other than "yes", the new value is 
         chills = case_when(chills == "yes" ~ 1,
                           TRUE           ~ 0),
         cough = case_when(cough == "yes" ~ 1,
                           TRUE           ~ 0),
         aches = case_when(aches == "yes" ~ 1,
                           TRUE           ~ 0),
         shortness_of_breath = case_when(shortness_of_breath == "yes" ~ 1,
                           TRUE           ~ 0))
# Make the plot
UpSetR::upset(
  select(linelist_sym_2, fever, chills, cough, aches, shortness_of_breath),
  sets = c("fever", "chills", "cough", "aches", "shortness_of_breath"),
  order.by = "freq",
  sets.bar.color = c("blue", "red", "yellow", "darkgreen", "orange"), # optional colors
  empty.intersections = "on",
  # nsets = 3,
  number.angles = 0,
  point.size = 3.5,
  line.size = 2,
  text.scale = 1.5,
  mainbar.y.label = "Symptoms Combinations",
  sets.x.label = "Patients with Symptom")

```
  



<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Preparation {  }

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse,
               UpSetR,
               ggupset)
```

<!-- ======================================================= -->
### View the data  

This linelist includes five "yes/no" variables on reported symptoms. We will need to transform these variables a bit to use the **ggupset** package to make our plot.  

View the data (scroll to the right to see the symptoms variables)

```{r, echo=F}
DT::datatable(linelist_sym, rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T))
```

<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Re-format values  

We convert the "yes" and "no the the actual symptom name. If "no", we set the value as blank. 

```{r}
# create column with the symptoms named, separated by semicolons
linelist_sym_1 <- linelist_sym %>% 
  
  # convert the "yes" and "no" values into the symptom name itself
  mutate(fever = case_when(fever == "yes" ~ "fever",          # if old value is "yes", new value is "fever"
                           TRUE           ~ NA_character_),   # if old value is anything other than "yes", the new value is NA
         
         chills = case_when(chills == "yes" ~ "chills",
                           TRUE           ~ NA_character_),
         
         cough = case_when(cough == "yes" ~ "cough",
                           TRUE           ~ NA_character_),
         
         aches = case_when(aches == "yes" ~ "aches",
                           TRUE           ~ NA_character_),
         
         shortness_of_breath = case_when(shortness_of_breath == "yes" ~ "shortness_of_breath",
                           TRUE           ~ NA_character_))
```

Now we make two final variables:  
1. Pasting together all the symptoms of the patient (character variable)  
2. Convert the above to class *list*, so it can be accepted by **ggupset** to make the plot  

```{r}
linelist_sym_1 <- linelist_sym_1 %>% 
  mutate(
         # combine the variables into one, using paste() with a semicolon separating any values
         all_symptoms = paste(fever, chills, cough, aches, shortness_of_breath, sep = "; "),
         
         # make a copy of all_symptoms variable, but of class "list" (which is required to use ggupset() in next step)
         all_symptoms_list = as.list(strsplit(all_symptoms, "; "))
         )
```

View the new data. Note the two columns at the end - the pasted combined values, and the list

```{r}
DT::datatable(linelist_sym, rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T))
```


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## `ggupset` {  }

Load required package to make the plot (**ggupset**)

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggupset)
```


Create the plot:

```{r}
ggplot(linelist_sym_1,
       aes(x=all_symptoms_list)) +
geom_bar() +
scale_x_upset(reverse = FALSE,
              n_intersections = 10,
              sets = c("fever", "chills", "cough", "aches", "shortness_of_breath")
              )+
  labs(title = "Signs & symptoms",
       subtitle = "10 most frequent combinations of signs and symptoms",
       caption = "Caption here.",
       x = "Symptom combination",
       y = "Frequency in dataset")

```
  
More information on **ggupset** can be found [online](https://rdrr.io/cran/ggupset/man/scale_x_upset.html) or offline in the package documentation in your RStudio Help tab. 


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## `UpSetR` {  }
The **UpSetR** package allows more customization, but it more difficult to execute:

https://github.com/hms-dbmi/UpSetR  *read this*
https://gehlenborglab.shinyapps.io/upsetr/ *Shiny App version - you can upload your own data*
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/UpSetR/UpSetR.pdf *documentation - difficult to interpret*


```{r}
pacman::p_load(UpSetR)
```

Convert symptoms variables to 1/0. 

```{r}
# Make using upSetR

linelist_sym_2 <- linelist_sym %>% 
  
  # convert the "yes" and "no" values into the symptom name itself
  mutate(fever = case_when(fever == "yes" ~ 1,          # if old value is "yes", new value is "fever"
                           TRUE           ~ 0),   # if old value is anything other than "yes", the new value is NA
         
         chills = case_when(chills == "yes" ~ 1,
                           TRUE           ~ 0),
         
         cough = case_when(cough == "yes" ~ 1,
                           TRUE           ~ 0),
         
         aches = case_when(aches == "yes" ~ 1,
                           TRUE           ~ 0),
         
         shortness_of_breath = case_when(shortness_of_breath == "yes" ~ 1,
                           TRUE           ~ 0))
```

Now make the plot, using only the symptom variables. Must designate which "sets" to compare (the names of the symptom variables).  
Alternatively use `nsets =` and `order.by = "freq"` to only show the top X combinations.  

```{r}

# Make the plot
UpSetR::upset(
  select(linelist_sym_2, fever, chills, cough, aches, shortness_of_breath),
  sets = c("fever", "chills", "cough", "aches", "shortness_of_breath"),
  order.by = "freq",
  sets.bar.color = c("blue", "red", "yellow", "darkgreen", "orange"), # optional colors
  empty.intersections = "on",
  # nsets = 3,
  number.angles = 0,
  point.size = 3.5,
  line.size = 2, 
  mainbar.y.label = "Symptoms Combinations",
  sets.x.label = "Patients with Symptom")

```
