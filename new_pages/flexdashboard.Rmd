# Dashboards with R Markdown { }

THIS PAGE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION

```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "flexdashboard_output.png"))
```

This page will cover the basic use of the **flexdashboard** package, which allows production of interactive dashboards from an R Markdown script with minimal complexity.  

Links to comprehensive tutorials on using **flexdashboard** can be found in the Resources section. Below we give an example of building a dashboard to explore the case `linelist` data.  


## Preparation

### Load packages {-}  

In this handbook we emphasize `p_load()` from **pacman**, which installs the package if necessary and loads it for use. You can also load packages with `library()` from **base** R. See the page on [R basics] for more information on R packages.  

```{r}
pacman::p_load(
  rio,            
  here,
  tidyverse,
  flexdashboard
)

```

### Import data {-}

We import the dataset of cases from a simulated Ebola epidemic. If you want to download the data to follow step-by-step, see instructions in the [Download book and data] page. The dataset is imported using the `import()` function from the **rio** package. See the page on [Import and export] for various ways to import data.

```{r, echo=F}
# import the linelist into R
linelist <- rio::import(here::here("data", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))
```

```{r, eval=F}
# import the linelist
linelist <- import("linelist_cleaned.xlsx")
```

The first 50 rows of the linelist are displayed below.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(head(linelist, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```


## New R Markdown  

of type "flexdashboard"

```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "flexdashboard_new1.png"))
```


```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "flexdashboard_new2.png"))
```


We will make the Rmd   "outbreak_dashboard.Rmd"

Alternatively,
