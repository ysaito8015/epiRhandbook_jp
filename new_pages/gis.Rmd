# GIS basics { }  


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Overview {  }

Spatial aspects of your data can provide a lot of insights into the situation of the outbreak to answer questions such as: 

* Where are the current disease hotspots?
* How the hotspots have changed over time?
* How is the access to health facility? Any improvements are needed?

In this section, we will explore basic spatial data visualization methods using **tmap** and **ggplot2** packages.
We will also walk through some of the basic spatial data management and querying methods with the **sf** package.

**Choropleth map**  

```{r, fig.align = "center", fig.show='hold', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gis_choropleth.png"))
```

**Density heatmap**  

```{r, fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gis_heatmap.png"))
```

**Health facility catchment area**

```{r, fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gis_hf_catchment.png"))
```

## Preparation {  }

**Load packages**  
First, load the packages required for this analysis:  


```{r}
pacman::p_load(rio,       # to import data
               here,      # to locate files
               tidyverse, # to clean, handle, and plot the data (includes ggplot2 package)
               sf,  # to manage spatial data using a Simple Feature format
               tmap,# to produce simple maps, works for both interactive and static maps
               janitor, # to clean column names
               OpenStreetMap # to add OSM basemap in ggplot map
               )   
```

**Sample case data**

```{r}
# import aggregated case counts of disease X
linelist <- rio::import(here::here("data", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))  
linelist <- linelist[sample(nrow(linelist), 1000),]

# Create sf object
linelist_sf <- 
     linelist %>%
     st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = 4326)

```


**Sierra Leone: Admin boundary shapefiles**  
Data downloaded from HDX:
https://data.humdata.org/dataset/sierra-leone-all-ad-min-level-boundaries

```{r}
# ADM3 level
sle_adm3 <- 
  sf::read_sf(here::here("data/shp", "sle_adm3.shp")) %>% janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(admin2name %in% c("Western Area Urban", "Western Area Rural"))

```


**Sierra Leone: Population by ADM3**  
Data downloaded from HDX:
https://data.humdata.org/dataset/sierra-leone-population

```{r}
# Population by ADM3
sle_adm3_pop <- 
     read.csv(here::here("data/population", "sle_admpop_adm3_2020.csv")) %>% janitor::clean_names()
```



**Sierra Leone: Health facility data from OpenStreetMap**  
Data downloaded from HDX:
https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_sierra_leone_health_facilities


```{r}
# OSM health facility shapefile
sle_hf <- 
        sf::read_sf(here::here("data/shp", "sle_hf.shp")) %>%
        janitor::clean_names() %>%
        filter(amenity %in% c("hospital", "clinic", "doctors"))
```

## Plotting coordinates {  }

The easiest way to plot the XY coordinates (points) is to draw a map directly from the sf object which we created in the preparation section.

**tmap** offers simple mapping capabilities for both static (*plot* mode) and interactive (*view* mode) with just a few lines of codes.

This blog provides a good comparison among different mapping options in R.
https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/324400_69a673183ba449e9af4011b1eeb456b9.html


```{r}
tmap_mode("plot") # or "plot"
#tm_shape(sle_adm3, bbox = st_bbox(linelist_sf)) +
tm_shape(sle_adm3, bbox = c(-13.3,8.43, -13.2,8.5)) +
  tm_polygons(col = "#F7F7F7") +
  tm_borders(col = "#000000", lwd = 2) +
  tm_text("admin3name") +
tm_shape(linelist_sf) + tm_dots(size=0.08, col='blue') 


```



<!-- ======================================================= -->
## polygons and shapefiles {  }

Choropleth maps can be useful to visualize your data by pre-defined area usually by administrative unit or health area for outbreak response to be able to target resources for specific area high incidence rates for example.

The current linelist data does not contain any information about the administrative units.
Although it is ideal to store such information during the initial data collection phase, we can also assign administrative units to individual cases based on their spatial relationships (i.e. point intersects with a polygon).

**sf** package offers various methods for spatial joins.
See more documentation about the st_join method and spatial join types here: 
https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/geos_binary_pred.html


**Spatial assign administrative units to cases**
First spatially intersect our case locations (points) with the ADM3 boundaries (polygons)

```{r}
linelist_adm <- 
     linelist_sf %>%
     sf::st_join(sle_adm3,   join = st_intersects) %>%
     select(names(linelist_sf), admin3name, admin3pcod)

# Now you will see the ADM3 names attached to each case
linelist_adm %>% select(case_id, admin3name)

```



Case counts by ADM3

```{r}
case_adm3 <-
     linelist_adm %>% as_tibble() %>%
     #filter(!is.na(admin3pcod)) %>%
     group_by(admin3pcod, admin3name) %>%
     summarise(cases = n()) %>%
     arrange(desc(cases))


case_adm3

```


**Choropleth mapping**
Now that we have the administrative unit names assigned to all cases, we can start mapping the case counts by area (choropleth maps).

Since we also have population data by ADM3, we can add this information to the *case_adm3* table created previously.

```{r}
# Add population data and calculate cases per 10K population
case_adm3 <-
     case_adm3 %>%
     left_join(sle_adm3_pop, by=c("admin3pcod"="adm3_pcode")) %>%
     select(names(case_adm3), total) %>%
     mutate(case_10kpop = round(cases/total * 10000, 3))

case_adm3

```


Join this table with the ADM3 polygons for mapping

```{r}
# Add population data and calculate cases per 10K population
case_adm3_sf <-
        case_adm3 %>%
        left_join(sle_adm3, by="admin3pcod") %>%
        select(objectid, admin3pcod, admin3name=admin3name.x, admin2name, admin1name,
               cases, total, case_10kpop, geometry) %>%
        st_as_sf()

```


Mapping the results

```{r}
# Number of cases
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(case_adm3_sf) + 
        tm_polygons("cases") +
        tm_text("admin3name")

```


```{r}
# Cases per 10K population
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(case_adm3_sf) + 
        tm_polygons("case_10kpop",
                    breaks=c(0, 10, 50, 100),
                    palette = "Purples"
                    ) +
        tm_text("admin3name")

```

<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Time series heatmap {  }

We can also look at the combination of time and space by facetting the heatmaps.

Set parameters for the basemap using the **OpenStreetMap** package.

```{r, warning = F, message=F}

# Fit basemap by range of lat/long coordinates. Choose tile type
map <- openmap(c(max(linelist$lat, na.rm=T), max(linelist$lon, na.rm=T)),  # limits of tile
               c(min(linelist$lat, na.rm=T), min(linelist$lon, na.rm=T)),
               zoom = NULL,
               type = c("osm", "stamen-toner", "stamen-terrain","stamen-watercolor", "esri","esri-topo")[1],
               mergeTiles = TRUE)

# Projection WGS84
map.latlon <- openproj(map, projection = "+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs")

```



**Heatmap by month of onset**

```{r}
# Extract month of onset
linelist$date_onset_ym <- format(linelist$date_onset, "%Y-%m")
 
# Simply facet above map by month of onset
# Plot map. Must be autoplotted to work with ggplot
OpenStreetMap::autoplot.OpenStreetMap(map.latlon)+
       # Density tiles  
       ggplot2::stat_density_2d(aes(x = lon,
                                    y = lat,
                                    fill = ..level..,
                                    alpha=..level..),
                              bins = 10,
                                geom = "polygon",
                                contour_var = "count",
                                data = linelist %>% filter(date_onset>='2014-08-01' & date_onset<='2015-01-31'),
                                show.legend = F) +
       #scale_fill_gradient(low = "black", high = "red")+
       labs(x = "Longitude",
            y = "Latitude",
            title = "Distribution of simulated cases by month of onset") +
       facet_wrap(~ date_onset_ym, ncol = 3)

```


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Health facility catchment area {  }

It might be useful to know where the health facilities are located in relation to the disease hot spots.


**Finding the nearest health facility**
We can use the *st_nearest_feature* method from the **sf** package to assign the cloest health facility to individual cases.


```{r}
# Closet health facility to each case
linelist_sf_hf <-
        linelist_sf %>%
        st_join(sle_hf,   join = st_nearest_feature) %>%
        select(case_id, osm_id, name, amenity)

```

We can see that "Den Clinic" is the closest health facility for about ~30% of the cases.

```{r}
# Group cases by health facility
hf_catchment <-
        linelist_sf_hf %>% as.data.frame() %>%
        group_by(name) %>%
        summarise(case_n = n()) %>%
        arrange(desc(case_n))

hf_catchment
```

Visualizing the results on the map

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(linelist_sf_hf) + tm_dots(size=0.08, col='name') +
        tm_shape(sle_hf) + tm_dots(size=0.3, col='red') + tm_text("name") +
tm_view(set.view = c(-13.2284,8.4699, 13), set.zoom.limits = c(13,14))
```


**Cases within 30 mins Walking distance from the closest health facility**

We can also explore how many cases are located within 2.5km (~30 mins) walking distance from the closest health facility.

Note: 
For more accurate distance calculations, it is better to re-project your sf object to the respective local map projection system such as UTM (Earth projected onto a planar surface). 
In this example, for simplicity we will stick to the World Geodetic System (WGS84) Geograhpic coordinate system (Earth represented in a spherical / round surface, therefore the units are in decimal degrees). We will use a general conversion of: 1 decimal degree = ~111km.

See more information about map projections and coordinate systems:
https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/gcs_vs_pcs/


First create a circular buffer with a radius of ~2.5km aroudn each health facility

```{r}
sle_hf_2k <-
        sle_hf %>%
        st_buffer(dist=0.02) # approximately 2.5km 
```

Intersect this with the cases

```{r}
# Intersect the cases with the buffers
linelist_sf_hf_2k <-
        linelist_sf_hf %>%
        st_join(sle_hf_2k, join = st_intersects, left = TRUE) %>%
        filter(osm_id.x==osm_id.y | is.na(osm_id.y)) %>%
        select(case_id, osm_id.x, name.x, amenity.x, osm_id.y)
```

Count the results

202 out of 1000 cases (20.2%, shown in red dots in the map below) live more than 30 mins away from the nearest health facility)

```{r}
nrow(linelist_sf_hf_2k)
nrow(linelist_sf_hf_2k[is.na(linelist_sf_hf_2k$osm_id.y),])
```

Visualize the results

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(linelist_sf_hf) + tm_dots(size=0.08, col='name') +
        tm_shape(sle_hf_2k) + tm_borders(col = "red", lwd = 2) +
        tm_shape(linelist_sf_hf_2k[is.na(linelist_sf_hf_2k$osm_id.y),]) +tm_dots(size=0.1, col='red') +
tm_view(set.view = c(-13.2284,8.4699, 13), set.zoom.limits = c(13,14))
```
