## Overview {  }

This page will cover methods to calculate and visualize moving averages, for:

## Preparation {  }

**Load packages**  

```{r}
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse,      # for data management and viz
  slider,         # for calculating moving averages
  tidyquant,      # for calculating moving averages on-the-fly in ggplot
)
```

## Calculate-then-display {  }

Using the package **slider** to calculate a moving average in a dataframe, prior to any plotting.  

In this approach, the moving average is calculated in the dataset prior to plotting:  

* Within `mutate()`, a new column is created to hold the average. `slide_index()` from **slider** package is used as shown below.  
* In the `ggplot()`, a `geom_line()` is added after the histogram, reflecting the moving average.  

See the helpful online [vignette for the **slider** package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/slider/vignettes/slider.html)  



* Can assign `.before = Inf` to achieve cumulative averages from the first row  
* Use `slide()` in simple cases  
* Use `slide_index()` to designate a date column as an index, so that dates which do not appear in the dataframe are still included in the window  
  * `.before`, `.after` TODO  
  * `.complete` TODO  
  * 


First we count the number of cases reported each day. Note that `count()` is appropriate if the data are in a linelist format (one row per case) - if starting with aggregated counts you will need to follow a different approach (e.g. `summarize()` - see page on Summarizing data).  

```{r}
# make dataset of daily counts and 7-day moving average
#######################################################
ll_counts_7day <- linelist %>% 
  count(date_onset, name = "new_cases") %>%    # count cases by date, new column is named "new_cases"
  filter(!is.na(date_onset))
```

The new dataset now looks like this:  

```{r}
DT::datatable(ll_counts_7day, rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 6, scrollX=T) )
```

Next, we create a new column that is the 7-day average. We are using the function `slide_index()` from **slider** specifically because we recognize that *there are missing days* in the above dataframe, and they must be accounted for. To do this, we set a our "index" (`.i` argument) as `the column `date_onset`. Since `date_onset` is a column of class Date, the function recognizes and when calculating it counts the days that do not appear in the dataframe. If you were to use another **slider** function like `slide()`, this indexing would not occur.  

Also not that the 7-day window, in this example, is achieved with the argument `.before = 6`. In this way the window is the day and 6 days preceding. If you want the window to be different (centered or following) use `.after` in conjunction.  


```{r}
## calculate the average number of cases in the preceding 7 days
ll_counts_7day <- ll_counts_7day %>% 
  mutate(
    avg_7day = slider::slide_index_dbl(    # create new column
        new_cases,                       # calculate avg based on value in new_cases column
        .i = date_onset,                 # index column is date_onset, so non-present dates are included in 7day window 
        .f = ~mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE),    # function is mean() with missing values removed
        .before = 6,                     # window is the day and 6-days before
        .complete = TRUE))               # fills in first days with NA
```


Step 2 is plotting the 7-day average, in this case shown on top of the underlying daily data.    

```{r}
ggplot(data = ll_counts_7day, aes(x = date_onset)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = new_cases), fill="#92a8d1", stat = "identity", position = "stack", colour = "#92a8d1")+ 
    geom_line(aes(y = avg_7day), color="red", size = 1) + 
    scale_x_date(
      date_breaks = "1 month",
      date_labels = '%d/%m',
      expand = c(0,0)) +
    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(0, NA)) + 
    labs(x="", y ="Number of confirmed cases")+ 
    theme_minimal() 
```

## Calculate on-the-fly {  }

TBD - **tidyquant**


```{r, eval=F}
per_pos_plot_county <- ggplot(data = filter(tests_per_county),
       aes(x = DtSpecimenCollect_Final, y = prop_pos))+
  geom_line(size = 1, alpha = 0.2)+  # plot raw values
  tidyquant::geom_ma(n=7, size = 2)+ # plot moving average
  theme_minimal_hgrid()+
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(as.Date("2020-03-15"), Sys.Date()), ylim = c(0, 15))+
  labs(title    = "COUNTY-WIDE TESTING PERCENT POSITIVE",
       subtitle = "Daily and 7-day moving average",
       y        = "Percent Positive",
       x        = "Date Specimen Collected")+
  theme_text_size+
  theme(axis.text = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "khaki")
        )
```
