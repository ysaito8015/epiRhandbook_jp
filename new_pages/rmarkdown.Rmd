# R Markdown reports { }  

R Markdown is a fantastic tool for creating automated, reproducible, and share-worthy outputs. It can generate static or interactive outputs, in the form of html, word, pdf, powerpoint, and others. 

<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Overview {  }

Using R markdown will allow you easily recreate an entire formatted document, including tables/figures/text, using new data (e.g. daily surveillance reports) and/or subsets of data (e.g. reports for specific geographies). 

This guide will go through the basics. See Resources section for further info. Other pages in this handbook expand on this page:  

* The page [Organizing routine reports] demonstrates how to routinize your report production with auto-generated time-stamped folders.  
* The page [Dashboards with M Markdown] explains how to format a R Markdown report as a dashboard.  



<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Preparation {  }

**Background to R Markdown**

To explain some of the concepts and packages involved:

* **Markdown** is a “language” which uses syntax that allows design of a document using plain text, so that it can be converted to html and other formats. It is not specific to R, and usually a markdown file has an ‘.md’ extension.
* **R Markdown**: This is an extension of markdown that _is_ specific to R, with file extensions '.Rmd'. This allows R code to be embedded in 'chunks' so that the code itself can be run, rather than just having a text document. 
* **rmarkdown - the package**: This is used by R to render the .Rmd file into the desire output. However its focus is the markdown (text) syntax, so we also need...
* **knitr**: This R package will read the code chunks, execute it, and 'knit' it back into the document. This is how tables and graphs are included alongside the text.
* **Pandoc**: Finally, pandoc is needed to actually convert documents into e.g. word/pdf/powerpoint etc. It is a software separate from R.  

In sum, the process involves feeding the .Rmd file to **knitr**, which executes the R code chunks and creates a new .md (markdown) file which includes the R code and its rendered output. The .md file is the processed by pandoc to create the finished product: a Microsoft Word document, HTML file, powerpoint document, pdf, etc.  

```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "markdown/0_rmd.png"))
```

(source: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html):

**Installation**

To create a R Markdown output, you need to have the following installed:

* The **rmarkdown** package, as described above  
* Pandoc, which should come installed with RStudio. If you are not using RStudio, you can download it here: http://pandoc.org. 
* If you want to generate PDF output (a bit trickier), you will need to install LaTeX. For R Markdown users who have not installed LaTeX before, we recommend that you install TinyTeX (https://yihui.name/tinytex/). You can use the following commands: 

```{r, eval=F}
pacman::p_load(tinytex)     # install tinytex package
tinytex::install_tinytex()  # R command to install TinyTeX software
```

<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Getting started {  }

### Install rmarkdown R package {-}

Install the **rmarkdown** R package. In this handbook we emphasize `p_load()` from **pacman**, which installs the package if necessary *and* loads it for use. You can also load packages with `library()` from **base** R. See the page on [R basics] for more information on R packages.  

```{r, eval=F}
pacman::p_load(rmarkdown)
```

### Starting a new Rmd file {-}

In RStudio, open a new R markdown file, starting with ‘File’, then ‘New file’ then ‘R markdown…’. 

```{r out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "markdown/1_gettingstarted.png"))
```

R Studio will give you some output options to pick from. In the example below we select "HTML" because we want to create an html document. The title and the author names are not important. If the output document type you want is not one of these, don't worry - you can just pick any one and change it in the script later. 

```{r out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "markdown/1_gettingstartedB.png"))
```

This will open up a new .Rmd script.

### Important to know {-}
 
**The working directory**

The working directory of a markdown file is wherever the Rmd file itself is saved. For instance, if the R project is within `~/Documents/projectX ` and the Rmd file itself is in a subfolder `~/Documents/projectX/markdownfiles/markdown.Rmd`, the code `read.csv(“data.csv”)` within the markdown will look for a csv file in the `markdownfiles` folder, and not the root project folder where scripts within projects would normally automatically look.

To refer to files elsewhere, you will either need to use the full file path or use the **here** package. The **here** package sets the working directory to the root folder of the R project and is explained in detail in the [R projects] and [Import and export] pages of this handbook. For instance, to import a file called "data.csv" from within the `projectX` folder, the code would be `import(here(“data.csv”))`. 

Note that use of `setwd()` in R Markdown scripts is not recommended – it only applies to the code chunk that it is written in. 

**Working on a drive vs your computer**

Because R Markdown can run into pandoc issues when running on a shared network drive, it is recommended that your folder is on your local machine, e.g. in a project within ‘My Documents’. If you use Git (much recommended!), this will be familiar. For more details, see the handbook pages on [R on network drives] and [Errors and help].  


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## R Markdown components {  }

An R Markdown document can be edited in RStudio just like a standard R script. When you start a new R Markdown script, RStudio tries to be helpful by showing a template which explains the different section of an R Markdown script. 

The below is what appears when starting a new Rmd script intended to produce an html output (as per previous section). 

```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "markdown/2_defaultRMD.png"))
```

As you can see, there are three basic components to an Rmd file.

### YAML metadata {-}

Referred to as the ‘YAML metadata’ or just ‘YAML’, this is at the top of the R Markdown document. This section of the script will tell your Rmd file what type of output to produce, formatting preferences, and other metadata such as document title, author, and date. There are other uses not mentioned here (but referred to in ‘Producing an output’). Note that indentation matters; tabs are not accepted but spaces are. 

This section must begin with a line containing just three dashes `---` and must close with a line containing just three dashes `---`. YAML parameters comes in `key:value` pairs. The placement of colons in YAML is important - the `key:value` pairs are separated by colons (not equals signs!).  

The YAML should begin with metadata for the document. The order of these primary YAML parameters (not indented) does not matter. For example:  

```yaml
title: "My document"
author: "Me"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
```

You can use R code in YAML values by writing it as in-line code (preceded by `r` within back-ticks) but also within quotes (see above example for `date: `).  

In the image above, because we clicked that our default output would be an html file, we can see that the YAML says `output: html_document`. However we can also change this to say `powerpoint_presentation` or `word_document` or even `pdf_document`.  


### Text {-}

This is the narrative of your document, including the titles and headings. It is written in the "markdown" language, which is used across many different software.  

Below are the core ways to write this text. See more extensive documentation available on R Markdown "cheatsheet" at the [RStudio website](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).  

#### New lines {-}  

Uniquely in R Markdown, to initiate a new line, enter *two spaces** at the end of the previous line and then Enter/Return.  



#### Case {-}  

Surround your normal text with these character to change how it appears in the output.  

* Underscores (`_text_`) or single asterisk (`*text*`) to _italicise_
* Double asterisks (`**text**`) for **bold text**
* Back-ticks (````text````) to display text as code  

The actual appearance of the font can be set by using specific templates (specified in the YAML metadata; see example tabs).  

#### Color {-}  

There is no simple mechanism to change the color of text in R Markdown. One work-around, *IF your output is an HTML file*, is to add an HTML line into the markdown text. The below HTML code will print a line of text in bold red.  

```md
<span style="color: red;">**_DANGER:_** This is a warning.</span>  
```

#### Titles and headings {-}  

A hash symbol in a text portion of a R Markdown script creates a heading. This is different than in a chunk of R code in the script, in which a hash symbol is a mechanism to comment/annotate/de-activate, as in a normal R script.  

Different heading levels are established with different numbers of hash symbols at the start of a new line. One hash symbol is a title or primary heading. Two hash symbols are a second-level heading. Third- and fourth-level headings can be made with successively more hash symbols.

```md
# First-level heading / title

## Second level heading  

### Third-level heading
```


#### Bullets and numbering {-}  

Use asterisks (`*`) to created a bullets list. Finish the previous sentence, enter two spaces, Enter/Return *twice*, and then start your bullets. Include a space between the asterisk and your bullet text. After each bullet enter two spaces and then Enter/Return. Sub-bullets work the same way but are indented. Numbers work the same way but instead of an asterisk, write 1), 2), etc. Below is how your R Markdown script text might look.  


```md
Here are my bullets (there are two spaces after this colon):  

* Bullet 1 (followed by two spaces and Enter/Return)  
* Bullet 2 (followed by two spaces and Enter/Return)  
  * Sub-bullet 1 (followed by two spaces and Enter/Return)  
  * Sub-bullet 2 (followed by two spaces and Enter/Return)  
  
```

#### In-line R code {-}  

You can also include minimal R code within back-ticks. Within the back-ticks, begin the code with "r" and a space, so RStudio knows to evaluate the code as R code. See the example below.  

#### Example {-}  

The example below shows multiple heading levels, bullets, and uses R code for the current date (`Sys.Date()`) to evaluate into a printed date.

```{r out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "markdown/2_text.png"))
```


### Code chunks {-}

Sections of the script that are dedicated to running R code are called "chunks". This is where you may load packages, import data, and perform the actual data management and visualisation. There may be many code chunks, so they can help you organize your R code into parts, perhaps interspersed with text. To note:
These ‘chunks’ will appear to have a slightly different background colour from the narrative part of the document.  

Each chunk is opened with a line that starts with three back-ticks, and curly brackets that contain parameters for the chunk (`{ }`). The chunk ends with three more back-ticks.  

You can create a new chunk by typing it out yourself, by using the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + Alt + i" (or Cmd + Shift + r in Mac), or by clicking the green 'insert a new code chunk' icon at the top of your script editor.

Some notes about the contents of the curly brackets `{ }`:

*	They start with ‘r’ to indicate that the language name within the chunk is R
*	After the r you can optionally write a chunk "name" – these are not necessary but can help you organise your work. Note that if you name your chunks, you should ALWAYS use unique names or else R will complain when you try to render.  
*	The curly brackets can include other options too, written as `tag=value`, such as:  
  * `eval = FALSE` to not run the R code  
  * `echo = FALSE` to not print the chunk's R source code in the output document  
  * `warning = FALSE` to not print warnings produced by the R code  
  * `message = FALSE` to not print any messages produced by the R code  
  * `include =` either TRUE/FALSE whether to include chunk outputs (e.g. plots) in the document
  * `fig.width = ` and `fig.height =` - provide in style `fig.width = "75%"`  
  * `fig.align = "center"` adjust how a figure is aligned across the page  
  * `fig.show='hold'` if your chunk prints multiple figures and you want them printed next to each other (pair with `fig.width = c("33%", "67%")`. Can also set as `fig.show='asis'` to show them below the code that generates them, `'hide'` to hide, or `'animate'` to concatenate multiple into an animation.  
* A chunk header must be written in *one line*  
* Try to avoid periods, underscores, and spaces. Use hyphens ( - ) instead if you need a separator.  

Read more extensively about the **knitr** options [here](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/).  

Some of the above options can be configured with point-and-click using the setting buttons at the top right of the chunk. Here, you can specify which parts of the chunk you want the rendered document to include, namely the code, the outputs, and the warnings. This will come out as written preferences within the curly brackets, e.g. ‘echo=FALSE’ if you specify you want to ‘Show output only’.  


```{r out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "markdown/3_chunk.png"))
```

There are also two arrows at the top right of each chunk, which are useful to run code within a chunk, or all code in prior chunks. Hover over them to see what they do.


For global options to be applied to all chunks in the script, you can set this up within your very first R code chunk in the script. For instance, so that only the outputs are shown for each code chunk and not the code itself, you can include this command in the R code chunk:  

```{r, eval=F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE) 
```




### Combining code and text {-}

Above we showed how you can integrate dynamic values such as today's date into the text. You can also use short functions (e.g. to calculate the min, median, max of a column) in the text, or integrate objects created within code chunks. 

The following calculates the proportion of cases that are aged less than 18 years old, using tidyverse code, and feeds it into the text. We see how it looks when knitted to a word document.

```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "markdown/3_chunktext.png"))
```


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## R Markdown structure {}


### Self-contained {-}  

For a relatively simple report, you may elect to organize your R Markdown script such that it is "self-contained" and does not involve any external scripts.  
In this scenario, one logical flow to consider might be:  

1) Set global **knitr** options  
2) Load packages  
3) Import data  
4) Process data  
5) Produce outputs (tables, plots, etc.)  
6) Save outputs, if applicable (.csv, .png, etc.)  

However, the above flow may not align with the needs of your report output - say you need to show your final figures "up front" at the beginning of the report.  

One solution is to break your code into other script, and have the final R Markdown simply combine the pre-processed outputs into a document.  

### Collect pre-processed outputs {-}  

In this approach, treat your R Markdown not as an engine to run a lot of R code, but more as a final collector document where you print outputs that have been created in other places. You can run / "source" these other scripts with the `source()` function from **base** R - R objects and figures created will be available to print in your final R Markdown.  

This approach can simplify your code and de-bugging, but you must be aware of various R *environments*. Objects created within an environment will not necessarily be available to the environment used by the R Markdown.  

```{r, eval=F}
source("your-script.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
# or sys.source("your-script.R", envir = knitr::knit_global())
```
```


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Producing an R markdown output {  }

Production of an R Markdown will depend on how you design it. We describe these options below: 

* **“Self-contained” R markdown**: This is when everything you need to run the R markdown is contained within the Rmd file, including all the code chunks and package loading. This can also include sourcing other scripts, but they will still be run during the course of knitting your Rmd file. These are appropriate when you do not need to do much data processing (e.g. it brings in a clean or semi-clean data file) and the running of the file will not take too long.  

* **R markdown combined with pre-processing**: This is when you pre-process objects that feed into your R markdown. For instance, you can load the packages, load and clean the data, and even create the graphs of interest. As long as this occurs in the same RStudio session and objects are saved to the environment, they can be called within the Rmd content. Then the R markdown itself will only be used for the final step, to produce the output with all the pre-processed objects. This is much easier to de-bug if something goes wrong.



### Self-contained script {-}  

For simple report, we recommend splitting up your code into different files, as it is horrible having to debug extremely long script, and especially horrible to debug an extremely long Rmd file. For example if there is an error within a code chunk, R will tell you which chunk had a problem, but will not tell you which line. 
The workflow also concerns the overall folder structure, such as having an 'output' folder for created documents and an 'input' folder for cleaned data. We do not go into further detail of further structure here, but the [Organizing routine reports] page discusses this further. 

### Producing a complete document {-} 

Now that you know the above, you can produce the document in the following ways:

#### Option 1: Render command {-}

One way to produce your R Markdown output is to run the `render()` function from the **rmarkdown** package. You would do this from the R Console or from a separate R script. In the example below, we have a separate R script in which we pre-process a `data` object into the R Environment and then render the "create_output.Rmd" using `render()`.  

```{r, eval=F}
data <- import("datafile.csv") %>%       # Load data and save to environment
  select(age, hospital, weight)          # Select limited columns

rmarkdown::render(input = "create_output.Rmd")   # Create Rmd file
```

In its simplest form, this approach will save the Rmd output to the same folder as your Rmd script, with the same file name aside from the file extension. For instance “create_output.Rmd” when knitted will create “create_output.docx” if you are knitting to a word document. 

For better version control, you can add further options to `render()` for the file name and save location. For instance, the following command will save the output file within an ‘outputs’ sub-folder, with the current date in the file name. We use the `str_glue()` function from **stringr** to do this, which will 'glue' together different character strings (written plainly) with R code (written in curly brackets). For instance if it is April 10th 2021, the file name from below will be “Report_2021-04-10.docx”. See the page on [Characters and strings] for more details.  

```{r, eval=F}
rmarkdown::render(
  input = "create_output.Rmd",
  output_file = stringr::str_glue("outputs/Report_{Sys.Date()}.docx")) 
```

As this file renders, the RStudio console will show you the rendering progress up to 100%, and a final message to indicate that the rendering is complete. 


#### Option 2: Knit button within R markdown  

When you have the Rmd file open, press the 'Knit' icon/button at the top of the file. This is RStudio’s shortcut button for the `render` function of **rmarkdown**. This is only compatible with a self-contained R markdown, where all the needed components are within the file.  It will not work to pre-process data or graphs and save them to the environment - the knitting will ignore these 'external' objects. 

Just like knitting with a separate script, R Studio will you show the progress of the Rmd file. Except this time, this will appear within an ‘R Markdown’ tab in the same panel as your console. A complete document will automatically open when complete and this document will be saved in the same folder as your markdown, and with the same file name aside from the file extension. This is obviously not ideal for version control, as you will then rename the file yourself.


```{r out.width = "90%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "markdown/4_progress.png"))
```



<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Parameterised reports {  }

We can use parameterisation to make our report dynamic, such that it can be run for a specific date or place or with certain knitting options. We focus on the basics here but there is a good amount of detail online: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html.

Using the Ebola linelist as an example, let’s say we want to run a standard surveillance report for each hospital each day. We show how one can do this using parameters.

**Important: it is possible to do this using simple R objects rather than using the parameter structure, which we explain at the end of this section (Parameterisation without the params object). **

### Setting parameters {-}

#### Option 1: Declare parameters within the YAML {-}

Edit the YAML to specify that `hospital` and `date` are parameters that are subject to change each time the report is run.

```yaml
---
title: Surveillance report
output: html_document
params:
 date: 2021-04-10
 hospital: Central Hospital
---
```

#### Option 2: Use parameters within the .Rmd text and code {-}

These parameters are contained within a read-only list called `params`. To use these parameters in the code, you refer to them with the object name. Continuing the example, `params$hospital` will load “Central Hospital”. 

Note that the `params$date` example saves the date as a string. You will need to use a function such as `as.Date` to change this to a date class. 

#### Option 3: Run the Rmd file - basic {-}  

As mentioned above, to produce the output we can Knit from within the document by simply clicking the ‘Knit’ button, or we can use the `render()` function from a separate script. In this later case, you can specify the parameters to be used in that rendering to the `params = ` arguement of `render()`. 

Note than any parameter values provided here will *overwrite* the default values written within the YAML. We write the values in quotation marks as in this case they should be defined as character/string values.

```{r, eval=F}
rmarkdown::render(
  input = "surveillance_report.Rmd",  
  output_file = stringr::str_glue("outputs/Report_{Sys.Date()}.docx"),
  params = list(date = "2021-04-10", hospital  = "Central Hospital"))
```


#### Option 4: Run the Rmd file - using the graphical user interface {-}  

For a more interactive feel, we can also use the graphical user interface (GUI). To do this we can click the drop-down menu next to ‘knit’ and choose ‘knit with parameters’, or we can specify `params = "ask" within the `render()` function.  

```{r, eval=F}
rmarkdown::render(
  input = "surveillance_report.Rmd",  
  output_file = stringr::str_glue("outputs/Report_{Sys.Date()}.docx"),
  params = “ask”)
```

Either way a pop-up will appear allowing us to type in the date and hospital of interest. 

```{r out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "markdown/5_parametersGUI.png"))
```

However, as this is subject to error and spelling mistakes, you may prefer to add restrictions to the parameters that can be selected. For instance we can introduce a drop-down with `choices: ` so that only the possible hospitals can be selected. We do this again in the YAML:

```yaml
---
title: Surveillance report
output: html_document
params:
 date: 2021-04-10
 hospital: 
  label: “Town:”
  value: Central Hospital
  input: select
  choices: [Central Hospital, Military Hospital, Port Hospital, St. Mark's Maternity Hospital (SMMH)]
---
```

When knitting with the 'knit parameters' dropdown button or by running the render function, a window with a drop-down will then pop up:

```{r out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "markdown/5_parametersGUIB.png"))
```

### Using parameters {-}  

You can use the parameters value in the R code chunks as you would another R object/value in your environment. Simply type `params$` followed by the parameter names. For example `params$hospital` to represent the hospital name. 

#### Use parameters in **knitr** options {-}  

Note that parameters can also hold values `true` or `false`, and so these can be included in your **knitr** options for an R chunk. For example, you can set `{r, eval=params$run}` instead of `{r, eval=FALSE}`, and now whether the chunk runs or not depends on the value of the parameter `run:`.  

#### Example {-} 

The following code uses basic parameters. We can see how the data is filtered to the specific hospital, and the titles refer to the correct hospital and date. We use the linelist_cleaned.rds file here, but it would be particularly appropriate if the linelist itself also had a datestamp within it to align with paramterised date. 

```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "markdown/6_Rmdexample.png"))
```

Knitting this produces the final output with the default font and layout.

```{r out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "markdown/6_RmdexampleB.png"))
```





### Parameterisation without the params object {-}

If rendering a Rmd file from a separate script, it is not actually essential to use the parameterisation options to run the Rmd file for subsets of data. 

For instance, we can simply specify the hospital and date as two objects before rendering the Rmd file. Within the Rmd file, we would not need to have a params section in the YAML, and we would refer to the `date` object rather than `params$date` and `hospital` rather than `params$hospital`. 

```md
hospital <- "Central Hospital"
date <- "2021-04-10"

rmarkdown::render(("create_output.Rmd"),  
                        output_file = paste0("outputs/Report_", Sys.Date(), ".docx")) 
```

This means you will not be able to “knit with parameters” and use the GUI, or to include knitting options within the parameters. However it allows for simpler code which may be sufficient.

<!-- ======================================================= -->

## Looping reports  {  }

We may want to run all options of a report at once, for instance a surveillance report for all hospital of interest within a single run, rather than specifying each hospital one by one. For this we need to work in a separate script outside the Rmd, and create a objects for today’s date and the list of hospital names to loop through.  

```md
hospital_list <- c(“Central Hospital”, 
                   “Military Hospital”, 
                   “Port Hospital”, “
                   St. Mark's Maternity Hospital (SMMH)”) 

refdate <- Sys.Date() # today’s date


```
We then feed this into the markdown using a loop, where we go through each item of the list. The letter `i` represents which item of the list is currently being iterated, such that `hospital_list[1]` would be “Central Hospital”. This information is also fed into the file name, such that the file name of the first iteration produced on April 10th 2021 would be “Report_Central Hospital2021-04-10.docx”, saved in the ‘output’ subfolder. In our examples, four files would be created for each day.

For instance, using the parameterisation discussed earlier: 

```md
for(i in 1:length(hospital_list)){
rmarkdown::render("surveillance_report.Rmd",
                  output_file = paste0("output/Report_", hospital_list[i], refdate, ".docx"),
                  params = list(date = refdate, hospital  = hospital_list[i]))
}       
```

The text and code within the Rmd itself will again refer to `params$date` and `params$hospital` to bring in the date and hospital name. The list items would not need to be referred to again within an interation. 

If not using this strict form of parameterisation but saving objects to the environment, as discussed at the end of the parameterisation section, the render function would look like this:

```md
for(i in 1:length(hospital_list)){
rmarkdown::render("surveillance_report.Rmd",
                  output_file = paste0("output/Report_", hospital_list[i], refdate, ".docx")
}       
```
The text within the markdown would then need to refer to `hospital_list[i]` and `refdate`. 

<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Formatting and aesthetics {  }

For easy aesthetics, create a template file which contains the desired formatting. You can create for instance an MS word or power point document which contains pages with the desired dimensions, watermarks, backgrounds, and fonts. 

### Word documents

To create a template, start a new word document (or use an existing output with  formatting the suits you), and edit fonts by defining the Styles. In Style,Headings 1, 2, and 3 refer to the various markdown header levels (`# Header 1`, `## Header 2` and `### Header 3` respectively). Right click on the style and click 'modify' to change the font formatting as well as the paragraph (e.g. you can introduce page breaks before certain styles which can help with spacing). Other aspects of the word document such as margins, page size, headers etc, can be changed like a usual word document you are working directly within. 

```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "markdown/7_template.png"))
```

### Powerpoint documents

As above, create a new slideset or use an existing powerpoint file with the desired formatting. For further editing, click on 'View' and 'Slide Master'. From here you can change the 'master' slide appearance by editing the text formatting in the text boxes, as well as the background/page dimensions for the overall page. 

```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "markdown/8_ppttemplate.png"))
```

Unfortunately, editing powerpoint files is slightly less flexible:

* A first level header (`# Header 1`) will automatically become the title of a new slide,
* A `## Header 2` text will not come up as a subtitle but text within the slide's main textbox (unless you find a way to maniuplate the Master view). 
* Outputted plots and tables will automatically go into new slides. You will need to combine them, for instance the the **patchwork** function to combine ggplots, so that they show up on the same page.

### Integrating templates into the YAML

Once a template is prepared, the detail of this can be added in the YAML of the Rmd underneath the 'output' line and underneath where the document type is specified (which goes to a separate line itself). Note `reference_doc` can be used for powerpoint slide templates.

It is easiest to save the template in the same folder as where the Rmd file is (as in the example below), or in a subfolder within. 

```yaml
---
title: Surveillance report
output: 
 word_document:
  reference_docx: "template.docx"
params:
 date: 2021-04-10
 hospital: Central Hospital
template:
 
---
```

### Formatting HTML files

HTML files do not use templates, but can have the styles configured within the YAML. HTMLs are interactive documents, and are particularly flexible. We cover some basic options here. 

* Table of contents: We can add a table of contents with `toc: true` below, and also specify that it remains viewable ("floats") as you scroll, with `toc_float: true`.

* Themes: We can refer to some pre-made themes, which come from a Bootswatch theme library. In the below example we use cerulean. Other options include: journal, flatly, darkly, readable, spacelab, united, cosmo, lumen, paper, sandstone, simplex, and yeti. 

* Highlight: Configuring this changes the look of highlighted text (e.g. code within chunks that are shown). Supported styles include default, tango, pygments, kate, monochrome, espresso, zenburn, haddock, breezedark, and textmate. 

Here is an example of how to integrate the above options into the YAML.

```yaml
---
title: "HTML example"
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
    theme: cerulean
    highlight: kate
    
---
```

Below are two examples of HTML outputs which both have floating tables of contents, but different theme and highlight styles selected:


```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "markdown/9_html.png"))
```
