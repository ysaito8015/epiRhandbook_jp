# Organizing routine reports {  }  

This page will cover the **reportfactory** package. **reportfactory** is a package developed by RECON (R Epidemics Consortium).  

**reportfactory** is an *accompaniment to using R Markdowns for reports*. It is built for scenarios where you are running routine reports (daily, weekly, etc.). It makes easier the organization and compilation of multiple R Markdown files and their outputs. In essence, it provides a "factory" from which you can run the R Markdown reports and automatically get organized date- and time-stamped folders with the outputs.  


## Preparation

### R project {-} 

Open a new R project, or have an existing one. See the page on [R projects] for instructions on how to create an R project. The report factory will live within the R project.  

Below, we have created an R project called "demo_factory". Currently there are no other files within the project.  


```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "factory_new1.png"))
```

### Packages {-}  

From within the open R project, install and/or load the **reportfactory** package from CRAN.  

In this handbook we emphasize `p_load()` from **pacman**, which installs the package if necessary and loads it for use. You can also load packages with `library()` from **base** R. See the page on [R basics] for more information on R packages. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(reportfactory)
```


## New factory  

Adding a new report factory will add a self-contained folder to the R project. Below we will create a factory within the empty "demo_factory" R project. The report factory itself will be called "new_factory" (the default name - this can be changed).  

Run the function `new_factory()`. You can run it with empty parentheses, or specifying argument values as explained below. By default, the factory will be a folder called "new_factory", added to the R project root folder.  

```{r, eval=F}
# This will create the factory folder in the current directory
new_factory()
```

Below see that the folder "new_factory" has been created

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "factory_new2.png"))
```

There are several defaults that you can change in the `new_factory()` command:  

* `factory = ` - You can provide a name for the factory folder. The default is as shown above: "new_factory".  
* `path = ` - You can designate a file path for the new factory. The default is the current directory.  
* `report_sources = ` You can provide an alternate name for the folder which holds the R Markdown scripts that create the reports. The default is "report_sources".  
* `outputs = ` You can provide an alternate name for the folder which holds the output reports. The default is "outputs".  

See `?new_factory` for a complete list of the function arguments.  


## Review the factory  

Looking inside the "new_factory" folder we can see that sub-folders were created automatically. You can adjust in the `new_factory()` command if you do not want these sub-folders to be created.    

* The *report_sources* folder should hold your R Markdown scripts, which generate your reports  
* The *outputs* folder will the report outputs (e.g. HTML, Word, PDF, etc.) - it will contain automatically-generated sub-folder organized by report and date-time stamp  
* The *scripts* folder can be used to store other R scripts that can be sourced/run by the R Markdown scripts (optional)  
* The *data* folder can be used to hold your data (optional)  
* A *.here* file was created, so now can reference any files in the sub-folders by their relation to this factory root folder (see [R projects] for more details about the **here** package)  
* A *gitignore* file was created in case you decide to link this to a Github repository (see [Collaboration with Github])  
* An empty README markdown file was created, to assist if using a Github repository  

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "factory_new3.png"))
```
 
Within R, you can run a command to see the structure (folders and files) in the report factory.  

```{r, eval=F}
reportfactory::factory_overview()
```

The following "tree" of the factory's folders and files is printed to the R console. You can see that there sub-folders for "raw" and "clean" data, some example CSV data. There is also an "example_report.Rmd" in the "report_sources" folder.    

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "factory_overview.png"))
```


## Create a report  

For purposes of example, we create a new R markdown script entitled "daily_sitrep.Rmd" and save it within the "report_sources" folder of the report factory. In it, the case linelist is imported from the "data" folder, summary tables and epicurves are printed in the report HTML output and exported as .csv and .png files respectively.

We also have added the data for the report ("linelist_cleaned.rds") to the "clean" sub-folder within the "data" folder. The new R Markdown script can source this data with the following command. To read more about importing data with the **rio** package and the **here** package see the page on [Import and export].  

```{r, eval=F}
linelist <- import(here("data", "clean", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))
```

Below is a screenshot of the beginning of the new R Markdown "daily_sitrep.Rmd". You can see that the output format is set to be HTML, via the YAML header `output: html_document`. Later in the report, there are commands to:  

* Print a summary table of cases, also exporting the table as a .csv file  
* Print an epicurve, also saving it as a .png image file  

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "factory_new_rmd.png"))
```

We can now see in the factory overview that a Rmd has been added to "report_sources" and the data file has been added as well (highlighted):

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "factory_overview2.png"))
```

## Review

You can review the R Markdown reports in the report_sources folder with this command:  

```{r, eval=F}
list_reports()
```



## Compile  

In a report factory, to "compile" a R Markdown report means that the .Rmd will be rendered (as HTML, Word, PDF, etc - however it is indicated in the YAML of the Rmd script). The report factory will auto-create a date- and time-stamped folder for the output in the "outputs" folder. The output and any exported files (e.g. csv, png, xlsx, etc. will be saved in this folder. The Rmd itself will also be saved in this folder, so you have a record of that version of the Rmd, as it was at that moment.  

This contrasts with the normal behavior of a rendered R Markdown, which will save to the location of the .Rmd. This default behavior can result in crowded, messy folders. The report factory aims to improve organization when one needs to run reports frequently.  

### Compile by name {-}  

You can compile a specific report by running `compile_reports()` and providing the name (without .rmd extension) to `reports = `. Below, this command would compile only the "daily_sitrep.rmd" report, rendering the HTML and saving all the products into a date- and time-stamped sub-folder specific to the report, within the "outputs" folder.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "factory_compile1.png"))
```


Note that when you compile, you will see several files temporarily appear in the "report_sources" folder - but they will soon disappear. 

### Compile by number {-}

You can also specify the Rmd to compile by feeding a number or vector of numbers to `reports = `. The numbers must align with the order the reports appear when you run `list_reports()`.  

```{r, eval=F}
# Run the second and fourth Rmds in the "report_sources" folder
compile_reports(reports = c(2, 4))
```

### Compile from sub-folder {-}  

You can add sub-folders to the "report_sources" folder. To run an R Markdown report from a subfolder, simply provide the name of the folder to `subfolder = `. Below is an example of code to compile a Rmd report that lives in a sub_folder of "report_sources".  

```{r, eval=F}
compile_reports(
     reports = "summary_for_partners.Rmd",
     subfolder = "for_partners")
```


### Compile all {-}

You can compile *all* the R Markdown reports in the "report_sources" folder by setting the `reports = ` argument to TRUE.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "factory_compile_all.png"))
```


### Parameterization {-}

As noted in the page on [R Markdown reports], you can run reports with specified parameters. You can pass these parameters as a list to `compile_reports()` via the `params = ` argument. For example, in this fictional report there are three parameters provided to the R Markdown reports.  

```{r, eval=F}
compile_reports(
  reports = "daily_sitrep.Rmd",
  params = list(most_recent_data = TRUE,
                region = "NORTHERN",
                rates_denominator = 10000),
  subfolder = "regional"
)
```

## Outputs  

After we have compiled the reports are few times, the "outputs" folder might look like this (highlights added for clarity):  

* Folders have been created for the outputs of each Rmd report  
* Sub-folders have been created for each unique compiling - these folders are date- and time-stamped ("2021-04-07_T20-11-25" means 7th April 2021 at 20:11:25)  
  * You can edit the date/time-stamp format. See `?compile_reports`
* Within each date/time compiled folder, the rendered output is stored (HTML, PDF, Word, etc.) along with the Rmd and any other exported files from the rendering (e.g. csv, png)  


```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "factory_overview_all.png"))
```


Here is a view inside one of the date/time-stamped folders, for the "daily_sitrep" report. File path folders are highlighted in yellow for emphasis.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "factory_compile_folder.png"))
```
Finally, below is a screenshot of the HTML report output. It is produced as normal for any R Markdown report.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "factory_html.png"))
```

## Review  

You can use `list_outputs()` to review a list of the outputs.  


## Extras  

* With **reportfactory**, you can use the function `list_deps()` to list all packages required across all the reports in the entire factory.  

* There is an accompanying package in development called **rfextras** that offers more helper functions to assist you in building reports, such as:  
  * `load_scripts()` - sources/loads all .R scripts in a given folder (the "scripts" folder by default)  
  * `find_latest()` - finds the latest version of a file (e.g. the latest dataset)
