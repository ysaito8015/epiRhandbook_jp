# Suggested packages

Below is a long list of suggested packages for common epidemiological work in R. You can copy this code and use `#` symbols to invalidate any packages you do not want.  

* Packages included within others are indicated by an indent and hash, as seen under **tidyverse**. Install **pacman** package first, before running the below, with `install.packages("pacman)`.  

Also, consider using the package **conflicted** to manage conflicts and masking of functions.
