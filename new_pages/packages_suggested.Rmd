# Suggested packages

Below is a long list of suggested packages for common epidemiological work in R. You can copy this code and use `#` symbols to remove any packages you do not want.  

* Packages that included when installing/loading another package are indicated by an indent and hash. For example as seen under **tidyverse**.  
* Install **pacman** package first, before running the below, with `install.packages("pacman")`.  

Also, consider using the package **conflicted** to manage conflicts and masking of functions.
